        <h4 class="heading">Description (more info)</h4>
        <div> 
            <p>There are objects in the world that are best described as
 priceless. This isn’t because of strong sentimental value like a gift 
from a friend who has passed on, a family heirloom, or a token of 
affection of a lost lover. These items are priceless because no pile of 
gold pieces can compare to the sheer opulence, rarity, or godlike 
craftsmanship that the thing possess. It is better to have the rarest 
and most sought after piece of art in the world and to have every single
 being of importance knowing your name and that you’re special because 
you own it, rather than simply being generically wealthy from the hordes
 of riches gained by selling it. These macguffins exist in real life and
 in fiction as objects to seek, trade or fight over, and something to 
possess and display rather than actually make use of. These range from 
artifacts, artist masterpieces, rare magics and opulent combinations of 
jewels and precious metals, such as The Mona Lisa, the Arkenstone, the 
Maltese Falcon, the crown jewels of a major dynasty, the Hope Diamond, 
the Golden Fleece, the hide of the Nemean Lion, the Holy Grail or Pulp 
Fiction’s glowing briefcase. These objects can be found in the throne 
rooms of kings, the demiplanes of archmages and the pinnacle of a 
dragon’s hoard.</p>

 cloak never becomes stained or dirty and always smells clean and fresh.
 While worn, the bearer’s shadow appears to have large, angelic wings 
and the bearer gains full mental control over their shadow’s movements. 
While worn the bearer gains advantage on all charisma checks (Diplomacy,
 intimidation, bluff, etc.) made against angels, who recognize the sight
 and smell of their kin. The bearer suffers disadvantage on all charisma
 checks made against demons, who recoil at the stench of their ancient 
foe.</p>

donned by a commoner, the metal becomes uncomfortably hot but causes no 
physical injury. A creature of noble blood (However slight), or destined
 to become a noble at some point in the future, who dons the ring 
suffers a momentary flash of light and pain which deals a single point 
of hit point damage. The bearer will find that the unicorn crest has 
reshaped itself to his own heraldry (Or a heraldry matching the bearer’s
 personality), which has also been branded upon the back of their 
finger. From then onward, the bearer can don or remove the ring without 
any further ill effects. If the ring is removed for more than a minute, 
the signet shifts back into the shape of a unicorn.</p>

which dance and flow around the player. The visual quality and movement 
of the notes depend on the skill of the musician. Fortunately the 
instrument passes along a basic knowledge of its use to bearer, granting
 the creature proficiency with it for as long as its held. Still, a 
naturally poor player with a shoddy or simple song produces small 
pitiful illusions that mope around, while a master musician playing an 
orchestral piece creates large vibrant illusionary notes that flow in 
tune with the melody. ---Note: The instrument: <span class="label label-primary linked-chart">Roll on <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9697/">"Random Musical Instruments"</a></span></p>

 mahogany music box whose working components are made of magically 
enchanted gold and silver. The object fills its bearer with a sense of 
musical snobbishness and the desire to listen to, record and play the 
finest instrumental music possible. When exposed to nonmagical music, 
the box can be commanded to record the song. The arcane clockwork device
 can hold up to ten songs and is able to reproduce them in perfect 
quality, whenever commanded. The music box is an exceptional judge of 
music and refuses to record music of a lesser quality of what it has 
already stored. Should the bearer attempt to save an eleventh song, it 
is compared to the other ten recordings and the objectively worst song 
is forgotten to make room for the new one. If the eleventh song is worse
 than the ten already stored the device does not record it or remove a 
stored song. The bearer has no control over this process which is seen 
as a blessing among musical circles, as it prevents user error and all 
but guarantees the music is of masterful quality.</p>

made exclusively of black iron, sporting 13 vicious looking spikes 
rising from its band. Humanoid faces showing frozen expressions of 
terror and pain cover the majority of it’s exterior. While worn, the 
faces animate and seem to be screaming in pain and terror although they 
do not make a single sound. The eye sockets of each face glows with the 
light of a single burning ember and begin to cry a slow stream of bloody
 tears onto the bearer. The tears burn like acid (Dealing one point of 
unpreventable acid or necrotic / unholy /profane damage per round) to 
good and neutral creatures but is completely harmless to evil bearers 
and does not effect objects or clothing whatsoever. Knowledgeable PC’s 
will know that the crown is called “Volbeat” and is a demonic royal 
symbol of the bearer’s power, ruthlessness and ability. Finding the 
crown is fairly simple as the devil who usually wears it never makes an 
effort to hide or blend in. The crown makes the bearer a target for 
lower ranking devils to kill him and take the crown, therefore cementing
 their own place as a prince of devils. This crown is infamous for never
 being on the same horned head for any length of time. In fact clever 
devils will sometimes place it on the heads of captured enemies as a 
torture device, letting the tears burn them slowly until the devil grows
 bored. Occasionally used to to convert captured enemies to evil by 
attaching the crown to their heads and placing tests in from of the 
subjects. For example: “Kill the other helpless prisoner and the burning
 will end. Your own life matters more than them and stopping the pain 
means more than their life.” If the subjects commit enough evil acts, 
their moral alignment changes and the crown will stop burning them. </p>

 When worn, the gemstones glow and shine with their own inner light, 
proclaiming the bearer is a true and rightful ruler. A knowledgeable PC 
will recognize the crown as an ancient method of proving the legitimacy 
of a person’s claim to the thrown, however it’s enchantment seems to be 
failing miserably. Any creature who dons the crown believes themselves 
to be the rightful ruler of the land they are standing on. While wearing
 the crown, the bearer cannot be dissuaded from that idea that they are 
royalty and will not wish to remove the crown under any circumstances. 
The crown’s effect’s fade the moment its removed and never cause the 
drinker to violate any of their strongly held ethics or morals.</p>

that was worn by a royal snob for the majority of his social outings. 
While worn, the bearer becomes an expert in etiquette and gains an 
uncanny knack for upper class social queues and manners. The bearer 
gains advantage on all knowledge checks related to high class etiquette,
 court manners, codes of royal social behavior and upper class social 
norms and gains advantage on all diplomacy checks made to interact with 
members of high society, royalty or nobility in a formal setting. 
However the ascot also imparts the arrogant, snobby and downright 
condescending way of holding oneself and tone of voice that creates 
resentment in those of the lower classes. The bearer suffers 
disadvantage on all charisma based checks (Diplomacy, intimidation, 
bluff, etc) towards creatures that are not nobility, royalty or general 
high society. This penalty includes servants, guards, maids, butlers and
 footmen who serve nobles and interact with them regularly but who are 
not nobles themselves. The ascot must be worn for one hour before the 
bearer gains the benefits, however the penalty to charisma checks takes 
effect immediately when worn.</p>

several layers of sealing wax. Inside the vial floats the blood and 
small chunks of brain matter harvested from a living Elder Brain of a 
Mind Flayer city. The vial has a preserving enchantment on it that keeps
 the blood and brain matter as fresh as if it was still alive. To say 
that this is a rare material would be to say that the sun is warm and 
only extremely knowledgeable PC’s would be able to identify it properly.
 Selling this object should theoretically be simple, as anyone familiar 
with the contents would covet the brain matter for their own personal 
gain and would buy it from the bearer. Selling the vial for the value of
 what it is actually worth will be next to impossible given its sheer 
rarity.</p>

bearing incredibly detailed humanoid pieces which rest on a checkerboard
 of deepest black and purest white. The underside of each piece as well 
as the board itself bears arcane runes of transmutation, illusion and 
memory. At a passing glance it is obvious that entire set has been 
enchanted with several magical effects. The board can understand verbal 
commands which allows the players to order their pieces to move 
remotely, negating the need to physically interact with the board at 
all. The board contains a measure of intelligence, strategies and 
movesets, allowing a single creature to play full games against the 
board itself. The creature can choose from a “simple” “moderate” or 
“challenging” difficulty setting which dictates the board’s level of 
skill. A creature can also set the board to have no players and simply 
watch the set play against itself and to begin a new game as soon as 
checkmate is reached, creating an endless loop of play. An individual 
chess piece that strays farther than ten feet from the set, instantly 
teleports back to its proper place on the board. Finally, the set can be
 commanded to pack itself up which causes the pieces to fold up the 
board along invisible seams collapsing the entire board into a fist 
sized marble cube that weighs one pound. The most obvious enchantments 
lie with the carved figurine pieces. While they remain within three feet
 of the board, the masterfully detailed pieces take on lifelike 
qualities. The stony faces of the pawns tighten into expressions ranging
 from nervousness and clueless bravado to outright terror as they fiddle
 with their makeshift weapons adapted from simple farming tools. Horses 
paw at the ground while their knights ready their maces and shields. 
Bishops raise hands and staffs to the sky as their mouths move to speak 
prayers of victory and hymns of battle, while miniature bowmen can be 
seen peeking from the rook’s archer slits. The kings and queens being 
the largest pieces have the most noticeable details and are perhaps the 
most impressive. The queens stand tall with a regal bearing, wearing 
well-fitting armor that is as functional and it is beautiful. Their thin
 tiaras hold back their shoulder length hair that blows dramatically in 
the wind but never obscures their faces. They each bear a single weapon,
 a heavy royal scepter, beautiful and deadly, which they wield in both 
hands. The kings on the other hand are haggard and stooped over as if 
weighed down by their garishly oversized crowns and heavy fur cloaks 
that trails on the ground. They wear foppish court clothes lacking any 
trace of actual protection and each hold (It would be too generous to 
call the action “wielding”) a small overly jeweled dagger with a sense 
of frantic paranoia in their marble eyes. When a piece would normally 
take another piece, the two figurines play out a few moments of a 
choreographed duel which ends in bloodshed and the death of the taken 
piece, which then moves itself to the side of the board.</p>
