            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

traveling clothes consisting of tainted animal skins, grisly hunting 
trophies and foul misshapen runes that are painful to look upon. A 
bearer who utilizes the wildshape, polymorph or other transforming 
ability or spell to turn into a beast, transforms into a rabid, vicious 
version of that animal that is clearly twisted and diseased. While in 
the animal form, all of the bearer’s natural attacks deal and additional
 dagger’s worth of poison damage (1d4). While transformed, the bearer 
suffers disadvantage on all checks made to pass himself off as a normal,
 inconspicuous or typical animal he has transformed into.</p>

                <td><p>Felix Felicis: A sealed glass vial containing an 
elixir the color of molten gold, with large drops leaping like goldfish 
from its surface, never spilling. If consumed, the drinker is infused 
with exceptionally good luck and feels as though they are likely to 
succeed in all endeavors in which success is possible. The user has a 
strong perception of this effect and gains a high level of confidence 
and a sensation of infinite opportunity. There is enough liquid in the 
vial to take three small sips. After taking a sip, for the next 1d4+1 
hours, whenever the drinker makes a skill check, attack roll or saving 
throw he can treat a d20 roll of 10 or lower as an 11. The elixir is not
 without a price however, as the solution is toxic can cause giddiness, 
recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence if taken in excess. There is 
also a 'coming down’ period when Felix Felicis wears off. During this 
time, the drinker’s sense of confidence fades, and unlucky circumstances
 can quickly catch up to him if he is not vigilant. It is unclear 
whether the elixir wearing off actually increases the user’s bad luck in
 a small overbalancing period, or whether the drinker is simply unused 
to the return of 'ordinary’ levels of luck and all the subsequent 
challenges and dangers. After the lucky effect wears off, the drinker is
 considered to be poisoned as the exiler’s toxic contents works through 
his system and whenever drinker makes a skill check, attack roll or 
saving throw he must treat a d20 roll of 12 or higher as an 11. These 
negative side effects last for twice as long as the lucky effect lasted 
for.</p>

 the bearer with the direction of the nearest active volcano. The 
obsidian glows red with the intensity of a candle’s flame if that 
volcano will naturally erupt within the next seven days.</p>

                <td><p>Scroll of Wild Magic: A ragged scroll, 
haphazardly pieced together from dozens of scraps of other spell 
scrolls. The bearer can read the scroll as part of casting a spell to 
activate the varied collection of magical effects. The caster 
immediately rolls on the Wild Magic Surge table and applies the result 
to the spell that was cast. The deluge of power rushing through the 
patchwork scroll is enough to tear it asunder and there is a 5% chance 
(A 1 on a d20) each time the scroll is used that it bursts into flame. 
This deals fire damage equivalent to two daggers (2d4) to the caster and
 completely consumes the scroll. —Note: For D&amp;D 5e players the DM 
can choose to have the player roll on my <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9704/">homebrew tables of effects on this blog</a>,
 the published Sorcerer’s Wild Magic Surge table or any other random 
effect table you can find. Should the player roll on a result that would
 be grossly detrimental for the campaign (Such as casting Fireball at 
their own feet resulting in a TPK) the DM should feel free to have the 
player reroll.</p>

 The pure, high pitched ringing the instrument creates physical is 
harmful to hellspawned devilkin. As an action equivalent to making an 
attack, the bearer can ring the bell in one hand causing all Fiendish 
creatures within 30 feet to suffer thunder damage equivalent to a dagger
 plus the wielder's level (1d4+level). If the bearer is proficient in 
handbells or the Perform skill, the Sacred Chime deals damage equivalent
 to a longsword plus the wielder's level (1d4+level) and the area of 
effect is increased to 40 feet.</p>

ring, save for a swirl of question marks engraved on the surface. 
Wearing the ring instills a subtle feeling of doubt within the bearer. 
This vague ambiguity can be harnessed and used to alter reality itself. 
Once per day after attuning to the band, the bearer may replace the 
result of any attack roll, skill check or saving throw d20 roll he makes
 for any reason by activating the ring. The bearer then rolls 3d20’s and
 uses the middle value of the three as the roll. If two or three of the 
results are the same, use that number. The bearer can harness the ring’s
 power after making the initial roll but before the outcome is 
determined and replaces the roll with the ring’s result even if it’s 
worse. The ring must be worn for at least eight continuous hours for the
 bearer to attune to it.</p>

badge in the shape of a kite shield that lacks any sort of marking or 
identification. When worn by a creature who has not broken any of the 
laws of the local area in the past 48 hours, the badge physically 
changes to a perfect copy of the types of badges worn by local 
authorities. Specifically the badge changes to look like that of the 
lowest ranking position of guard, watch member, peace officer, military 
police, deputy or other legitimate law enforcement of the area. The 
badge displays the bearer’s correct name and generates a random unused 
serial number if the local badges need either. The badge reverts to its 
blank state if it leaves the bearer’s possession for more than a minute 
and takes one minute of wear for it to shift into a local badge.</p>

root of a long-dead tree. It is charred and rough to the touch. The 
bearer becomes extraordinarily resilient to any harmful poisons, 
diseases, alchemical concoctions or potions taken through the mouth and 
automatically passes any saving throws on toxins consumed in such a way.
 However the ring’s nullifying magic is not of discerning tastes 
(Literally and figuratively) causing all food and drink tastes like ash 
to the wielder no matter how it’s flavored and whenever the bearer 
consumes a beneficial potion there is a 50% chance that the ring dispels
 it completely and the potion has no effect. The ring must be worn for 
at least 24 hours before the effects begin and the magic affects the 
wielder’s metabolism for ten minutes after the ring is removed.</p>

 vials of a specialized acid known as Ironbane. This alchemical solvent 
affects only iron and other metals weaker than adamantine and is 
completely harmless when exposed to skin or non-metallic items. Each 
vial of Ironbane deals triple the damage acid normally deals, but only 
to metal objects or creatures made entirely of metal (Such as iron 
golems) and ignores material hardness and resistances. The bearer can 
throw Ironbane acid as a grenadelike weapon, in which case it damages 
any metal armor, weapon, or shield that the target might be wearing or 
wielding.</p>

scintillating, blue-iron horseshoes with wave designs hammered into 
them.  Any mount fitted with these shoes can walk on calm water up to 
five feet deep as if it were solid ground. The water’s current (If any) 
will carry the animal along as if the ground were moving under their 
feet. Rushing torrents, rough seas and rapids are difficult and 
hazardous footing that will dump the mount in the water if he is not 
careful. If the water is more than five feet deep, the horseshoes 
instantly cease to function until the animal returns to the shallows. </p>

 handprint design on its front. If a willing creature places their hand 
on the handprint design and says “My life.” a detailed objectively 
written biographical history of their life will instantly write itself 
in the pages over the course of the next hour. The book can be updated

magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (See Note). 
While wearing the bridle, the animal is treated as if it was a 
well-trained mount, loyal to its rider and is capable of performing a 
number of tricks regardless of its actual training, which include: 
Fetch, Stay, Move, Run and Come. The bridle only affects the animal 
while it is worn and the creature reverts to its previous training after
 the item is removed. —Note: Possible mounts include as riding dogs,

 damage he reduces the amount taken by the equivalent of a dagger (1d4) 
to a minimum of 0.</p>

alchemical stimulants and minor rejuvenating magic. When applied to 
injuries, the salve works its way inward, cleaning the wound, numbing 
pain and jumpstarting the healing process. Compared to standard healing 
potions, this process is not quick, but it takes only a portion of the 
jar to cover a typical combat laceration. If the salve is applied and 
the creature is able to spent at least one minute resting or doing 
nothing but light activity (Such as reading, sitting or speaking) the 
injured patient regains hit points equal to two daggers worth of damage 
plus one hit point per their character level (2d4+1/per level). If the 
mixture is applied during combat or if the injured creature fails to 
rest for one minute, the wound is not able to heal as much as it could 
have and the patient only regains hit points equivalent to one dagger’s

ivory plates, its pegs and details carved of bone and the grillwork of 
its soundbox woven from splinters of baleen. Only amongst the gut of its
 strings is there notable pigment, four of said strings are a deep 
crimson hue. Twice per day, a creature proficient with the lute or 
proficient in the perform skill may use the Boneheart as a focus while 
casting a spell targeting one or more undead creatures (Even if the 
spell could not normally target undead) to play a mournful tune. This 
sorrowful melody stirs the memories of a previous life in even the 
barest remnant of a soul that an undead creature may have. The dirge is 
not perfect however and the undead will soon shake off whatever 
enchantment is placed on it as it forgets the deep emotions of its 
living form. Using Boneheart, the bearer causes the undead to be 
affected by the spell even if the undead could not normally be affected 
or is immune to the effect. When this occurs, the spell placed on the 
undead has its duration reduced by half to a minimum of one round.</p>

produces an aura that saps away the life of dying creatures too small to
 be seen with the naked eye (Viruses, bacteria and cells), drawing the 
sparks of their being into the metal, while causing no harm to bearer. 
An arcane glyph pulls in and accumulates the residual magical 
by-products that are created as part of casting a spell that would

fire. Transmutation icons absorb electrical, thermodynamic and magnetic 
potential causing the area immediately around the bearer to be a touch

pictographs draw wisps of raw natural vitality from nearby ley lines and
 bind the organic essence to the bracelet. Another handful of different 
insignia similarly absorb tiny amounts of power each from their own 
unique sources. The wildly different energies are aggregated into an 
internal reservoir of power that can be burned as supernatural fuel for 
the bearer’s magic. As an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the 
bearer can draw energy from the bracelet to regain a level 1 spell slot,
 or your game’s equivalent in mana or encounter powers. The bracelet

 all. The bearer can spend one minute honing a nonmagical weapon or 
mundane piece or ammunition that deals piercing or slashing damage, 
sharpening it to a fine point and leaving a dull red sheen along the 
edge and tip. For the next eight hours, the first time the weapon deals 
damage it deals an additional damage equal to a shortsword (1d6). After 
causing a greater injury than normal, the supernaturally fine edge fades
 back to normal and the weapon loses the red sheen. Each time a weapon 
is sharpened with the stone there is a 1% chance, (1 on a d100) that the
 stone cracks in half releasing a small swarm of flying red ants that 
quickly disperse, destroying the stone.</p>

The magical soup can feed up to four human sized creatures and each

significance to them, such as their mother’s chicken soup or father’s 
elk stew. Consuming the broth over the course of at least one minute is

 hit points equivalent to a dagger’s damage (1d4). The nourishing and

delicate looping script and set with a sparkling ruby. If the gem is 
rubbed or polished it begins to put off wisps of scarlet smoke and the 
bearer is able to mentally communicate with the genie that resides 
within it. The djinn is a young member of its race and inexperienced in 
the ways of the world and has chosen to life within the ring and travel 
the world on various fingers while he finds himself and practices his 
wish granting powers. The genie will gladly help any bearer who wears 
the ring openly and travels to new places or experiences new and 
exciting situations on a regular basis, which is the definition of most 
adventurers. The adolescent djinn is able to grant wishes in a very 
limited fashion on a semi-regular basis and though he always tries his 
best to fulfill the letter and meaning of the wish (Never twisting the 
wish to harm or punish the bearer), he often simply does not have enough
 skill to carry out the request or even reliably replicate his 
supernatural power. As an action equivalent to attacking, the bearer can
 rub the ruby and make a wish a wish to the genie by stating a problem 
that needs to be solved or requesting an action. As part of the same 
action the djinn will cast a spell that it believes will aid in the 
situation. The DM chooses any cantrip or level 1 spell that will 
accomplish the goal at least in part and it is cast from the ring using 
the genie’s bonuses (See Note). Should the wish be too complicated, 
unclear or out of the scope of the djinn’s abilities, it apologizes for 
being unable to help and the bearer’s action is wasted but the bearer 
could reword the request on his next turn. Successfully granting a wish 
is strenuous for the genie and it requires three full days of rest 
before being able to grant a wish again. —Note: The genie’s spell attack
 rolls and spell save DC’s should be equivalent to a level 1 spell 
scroll. An example of use: The bearer is facing down a wounded troll and
 needs to harm it with fire but has no means to do so. He rubs the ring,
 gestures to the creature and says “Burn it!”, and the genie casts a 
level 1 spell that deals fire damage at the troll. A bearer who is 
trying to aid a party member who is heavily injured and magically cursed
 uses the ring and says “I wish he was healthy again”. The genie is too 
weak to break the curse but is able to cast a level 1 healing spell on 
the target. Using the ring to make someone fall in love with the bearer 
could result in the genie casting Charm Person on the target instilling a
 temporary enchantment effect that once worn off leaves the target 
feeling repulsed and betrayed.</p>
