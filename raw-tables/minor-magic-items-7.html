            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

bendy cherry wand with a core of dragon heartstring. The wand is imbued 
with a memory forgetfulness charm and can be used to erase the last 60 
seconds the target experienced. Twice per day the wielder can wave the 
wand at a living creature they can see within 15 feet and speak the 
command word which causes the target to lose all memory of the previous 
minute. —Note: Should this item prove to be too powerful, the DM can 
allow a save to resist the wand’s effect at whatever difficulty check 
the DM feels is fair.</p>

 that always feel comfortable and steady in the hand, as if it was made 
perfectly for whoever happens to be holding it. The set is completely 
mismatched in terms of decoration and material, as every single 
individual tool was collected from a different master craftsman who 
inherited it from the master craftsman who trained them. Together the 
whole of the toolkit is far greater than the sum of its parts and the 
combined wisdom and knowledge of hundreds of years of talent and 
practice lend their skill to the bearer’s hands. A layman quickly 
becomes capable in their use and an already capable artisan becomes as 
reliable as death and taxes. As long as the toolkit has been on the 
bearer’s person for at least an hour he is considered proficient with 
the tools. If the bearer was already proficient with those tools and 
makes a skill check involving them, when the player rolls the d20, he 
treats a roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>

thin and frail for combat but easily cuts flesh. It can be used as a 
dagger but due to its delicate nature instead of rolling damage it deals
 the minimum result possible (A 1 on a 1d4) whenever the wielder lands 
an attack. Best employed on a helpless or dying target, whenever a 
living creature is killed by the Bone Razor, the creature’s flesh begins
 to peel off and its bones animate as a skeleton under the control of 
the bearer. The undead will follow his verbal commands to the best of 
its ability. The creature’s flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a 
steady rate. The bearer can spend one minute reattaching the flesh to 
the animated skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a
 normal corpse (Though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife
 wounds). If the bearer uses the razor to flense and animate another 
creature’s bones, the previous animated skeleton is immediately 
destroyed.</p>

superstitious markings and symbols meant to bring good fortune. The 
vessel is nearly full of good whiskey that makes the drinker feel oddly 
lucky when sipped. When carried in a breast pocket, the flask will 
unerringly attract the first lethal projectile that would hit the bearer
 to itself. The first time that the bearer would be reduced to zero hit 
points or killed outright by an arrow, bolt, bullet or thrown weapon, 
the projectile is instead blocked by the flask ruinously denting it but 
preventing all damage that the bearer would have taken and the player 
records the exact amount of damage prevented. After this occurs the 
flask is heavily damaged and does not provide its protective charm 
unless someone skilled in the art of distilling spirits can mix a 
special batch of lucky liquor to restore it. The bearer can examine the 
extent of the flask’s damage in its relation to the marred lucky symbols
 and mix a batch a unique blend of water, grain mash, yeast and an 
auspicious ingredient meant to bring good fortune, (Such as iron 
shavings from a lucky horseshoe, a four leaf clover or tufs of rabbit’s 
foot fur) together within the flask. At the next dawn the flask mends 
itself of all damages and contains a finely mixed liquor that makes its 
drinker feel oddly lucky. Repairing Drinker’s Luck after it has blocked a
 projectile requires proficiency in brewer’s tools, an hour of work and 
costs a number of gold pieces equal to the amount of damage it prevented
 plus five.</p>

                <td><p>Equinculus Potion: A sealed glass vial filled 
with a translucent liquid. Careful inspection reveals a miniature horse,
 smaller than a fingernail, floating comatose in the vial. If consumed, 
the drinker feels unbelievably nauseous and begins puking until the end 
of their next turn. During this time, the drinker vomits up a 
mucus-covered amniotic sac that rapidly gestates over the course of one 
round into a full-sized adult riding horse. The horse is tame, initially
 quite moist, and bonds with the drinker as though it were its mother. 
The equine is a real flesh as blood animal no different from any other 
natural born horse. It seems to be well trained, able to take riders, 
pull carts and will not panic in combat. The drinker automatically 
succeeds on all animal handling checks made in regards to the horse and 
the animal will always follow the drinker’s commands to the best of its 
ability. Using this potion draws upon the drinker’s own energy reserves,
 causing him to be exhausted as if he’d spent a night without sleep.</p>

                <td><p>Evoker’s Wand: A sturdy wand crafted from a solid
 branch of darkwood. Simple silver bands adorn both ends of the staff. 
The arcane implement bears traces of evocation magic and is infused with
 a <a href="https://tabletoptrinketsbyjj.tumblr.com/post/664171717400363008/rollable-unique-metamagic-options">Random Metamagic Power</a>,
 allowing the wielder to use it as a spellcasting focus and to alter the
 essence of spells tied to its nature. The wielder can activate the wand
 twice per day as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Until the 
start of the wielder’s next turn, if he casts a spell from the school of
 Evocation, the spell is augmented with the Metamagic power that the 
focus is attuned to. A bearer capable of casting spells can adjust the 
Metamagic formula during the course of a delicate one-hour ritual. At 
the end of the procedure the player rolls a d20 and on a 1, the bearer 
causes the supernatural architecture to collapse and the focus crumbles 
into ashes and is destroyed. If the implement survives, the bearer rolls
 randomly on the <a href="https://tabletoptrinketsbyjj.tumblr.com/post/664171717400363008/rollable-unique-metamagic-options">Metamagic Options table</a> and can either choose to keep the current Metamagic power or change it to the new one.</p>

contains a mixture of flower petals, ground up crickets, and sand. Twice
 per day as an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell, the 
bearer can reach into the pouch, withdraw a handful of the contents and 
throw it in the face of a creature within five feet. The bearer rolls a 
number of dice equivalent to five shortswords worth of damage (5d6) and 
if the target’s current hit points are equal to or less than the result 
of the roll, the victim falls unconscious. The target remains 
unconscious for one minute, until they take damage or another creature 
uses an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell to shake them 
awake. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed or being unconscious
 (Such as constructs and elementals) cannot be affected by the Pouch of 
Slumber. If the target has more hit points than the result of the roll 
the target is competently unaffected other than being covered in sand 
and debris.</p>

 masterwork quality that produces clear, resonating tones that manages 
to rise above the level of other sounds in the area. Rather than being 
louder than other instruments, the music this one creates carries better
 and can be heard twice as far away as normal as if the area had 
incredible acoustics. Bearer’s proficient with this type of instrument 
or in the Perform skill can use it as a focus for spells that include 
verbal components or require the target to hear the spellcaster. The 
vibrations the instrument generates allow even deaf creatures within 30 
feet of the performer to hear the music and be affected by abilities or 
spells channeled through the instrument.</p>

strange device consisting of arcs of carefully crafted bronze and silver
 orbiting a complicated arrangement of glass spheres. Knowledgeable PC’s
 will recognize it as a celestialabe which is similar in use to an 
astrolabe. Its key difference lies in the fact that it can be adjusted 
for changing heavens. Every piece can be slowed down, sped up, moved or 
removed. Extra pieces are packaged with the celestialabe in its hardwood
 case for inclusion if needed. The bearer can add 1d4 to the result of 
skill checks made to navigate planes other than the prime material plane
 or to identify what plane they are currently on. If a bearer spends at 
least ten minutes making adjustments and consulting the Celestialabe 
immediately before casting a casting a teleportation or planar shifting 
spell, the caster can roll an additional time and choose the best result
 should they need to make a roll to determine how accurate the 
teleportation or planar travel was.</p>

 of giant’s blood infused with transmutation magic. A creature can 
consume the contents as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, 
causing the drinker and everything he’s wearing and carrying to double 
in all dimensions, and his weight is multiplied by eight. This growth 
increases its size by one category (From medium to large for example) 
and while enlarged he has advantage on skill checks and saving throws 
that rely on strength. The drinker’s weapons also grow to match its new 
size and while enlarged, the target’s melee attacks deal a dagger’s 
worth of additional damage (1d4). These effects last for one hour before
 the drinker and his equipment shrink back to normal size. The drinker 
can end this effect early by making himself throw up as an action 
equivalent to attacking or casting a spell.</p>

 by a stiff breeze. No matter its circumstances, the feather remains 
absolutely pristine, free of blood, gore, stains, and bent barbs, 
remaining perfect and pure. A creature holding the staff is imparted 
with a strong sense of good and evil and the desire to see justice done 
and the corruption of the world purged away. When activated, the feather
 glows with a warm light equivalent to a torch for a few moments and 
chimes a single pure, piercing note. The implement is infused with a <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Random Metamagic Power</a>

the essence of spells tied to its nature. The wielder can activate the

the spell with the Metamagic power that the implement is attuned to. The

additional spell slot of the same level or higher (Minimum level 1) or

 a PC can actually see the inch-wide venom channel at the tip of the

he is wearing and carrying are treated as if they were completely 
encased in a foot of lead or in an antimagic zone when targeted by a 
spell designed to scry or detect the bearer or discern his location. For
 example, if a mage were to scry an area that the bearer happened to be 
in, he would see the location as normal except that the bearer would be 
considered invisible and muted to his perception. If the mage were to 
attempt to scry the bearer by specifically targeting him, the spell

has a certain amount of physical substance and stays in place allowing 
it to be sculpted in the air while being formed and after it’s formed.

Claymaidens. They see themselves as the embodiment of Chauntea’s 
creative muse. Espousing earth as the womb of all agriculture, the 
clerics mold clay in all shapes. Their vases are prized for their beauty
 and are found in noble houses all over the lands, but they are best 
known for embedding healing runes into baked tiles called shards. In 
their mind the humanoid form is simply a form of animated clay baked in 
the motherly womb. A braided cord is strung through a small hole in the 
tile allowing it to be worn around the neck. As an action equivalent to 
drawing a weapon, the bearer can snap or crush the tile, breaking the 
healing rune inscribed on the surface. Upon doing so, the tile releases a
 burst of curative power that heals the bearer or a creature of the 
bearer’s choosing within 5 feet an amount of hitpoints equal to four 
daggers worth of damage (4d4). If the creature is at zero hit points or 
is dying from their injuries, the target is healed for the maximum 
amount of hit points possible (16) rather than rolling for it. Once the

obsidian shards. The bearer can cover up to six, five-foot squares that

wood bound tome. On the front of the book where there would normally be a
 title or author, there is a rectangular piece of slate built into the 
wood with the words “Bronze Dragons” written in chalk. The book’s pages 
are filled with parts of written and illustrated works by numerous 
different authors all centered on the subject of bronze dragons. There 
are single chapters of adventure stories where bronze dragons are 
mentioned, a news article about a bronze dragon, a local legend about a 
bronze dragon living in an old volcano, a page from a bestiary written 
by a retired adventurer, an alchemical essay for how to safely use 
bronze dragon’s blood, and then a sorcerer’s essay that directly 
contradicts that essay, etc. Once per day, the bearer can erase the 
words on the slate and write down a different subject up to five words 
in length and close the book with a single gold piece within the pages. 
The book’s pages instantly change to provide a variety of different, 
common and uncommon sources of written works on the subject. If the book
 is used as part of a knowledge, lore, history or other similar 
intelligence based skill check, the book serves as a fairly reliable 
source of general information. During the check, when the player rolls 
the d20, he treats a roll of 9 or lower as a 10. This requires the 
bearer to spend a gold piece to change the book’s subject and spend five
 minutes skimming over the various entries.</p>

only recently removed from its former owner. The fang is so immense that
 a PC can actually see the inch-wide venom channel at the tip of the 
fang. A single bloated drop of venom rests at the end of the channel in a
 perpetual state of near drip. A creature holding the staff feels an 
unpleasant warm tingling sensation in their hands, as if a fraction of 
its power somehow penetrated the wielder’s skin. The implement is 
infused with metamagic power, allowing the wielder to use it as a 
spellcasting focus and to translate aspects of certain spells into more 
desirable results. Twice per day when the wielder casts a spell that 
deals damage, he can filter the magic through the staff to convert 100% 
of that damage to poison.</p>

pricked by the hairpin and if the victim’s result is higher than the

these wands were created by the archpriests and master embalmers of the 
desert land who prepared their dead in mummification rituals so that 
they could be resurrected by their God at a later time. Unfortunately 
the pyramids and burial sites of their deceased loved ones were 
routinely desecrated by necromancers who raised the preserved corpses as
 undead abominations, thus rendering that soul incapable of ever 
properly returning to its mortal form. An armory of wands like these 
were fashioned to repel the undead creations and guard the graves 
against future necromancers. The rage of the archpriests and embalmers 
burned long and cold and after they had created enough wands to arm 
their own citizens, they began selling the implements abroad at cost to 
ensure that all countries within any of their trade routes could stamp 
out those who would defile the dead and raise them up. On the wielder’s 
turn he can target a creature he can see within 60 feet and activate the
 wand as an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell, coating

have never raised undead, suffer no damage or negative effects and are

creature, when the wand is activated instead of dealing damage to the

allowing the wielder to draw on all of the memories of emotional and 
physical pain of the wand’s minds and thrust that pain onto a nearby 
creature. The wand is perfectly accurate at close range and if the 
target is within 5-30 feet the creature suffers psychic damage 
equivalent to a dagger plus the wielder’s character level (1d4+level) 
and half that damage if the target is 35-60 feet from the wielder.</p>

 spoon made of bone that occasionally twitches when near raw meat. A 
creature wielding the wand can direct necromantic energy to animate a 
nearby cut of meat or entire corpse (No bigger than twice his size) to 
cut, prepare, marinate, and cook itself. A slaughtered pig will seek out
 gravy to roll around in, a headless chicken will pluck and quarter 
itself, a rabbit corpse will carefully skin and gut itself before 
vaulting into the stewpot and sausages will jump into the saucepan, then
 plate themselves when cooked. The wielder must maintain concentration 
and line of sight on the meat and the cooking process at all times and 
must consciously direct the meat in how it will prepare itself. The 
wielder is granted advantage on any checks made to cook or prepare food 
that is mostly meat and can prepare those meals in half the time. 
Corpses animated by the wand cannot make any other actions other than to
 prepare themselves for food purposes. The trace amount of necromantic 
magic irradiating the meat kills off all traces of poison and disease, 
purifying the meal while dissipating moments after the wand is put down 
making the formerly animated meat perfectly safe to consume.</p>

 spellcasting focus and twice per day, the bearer can take an action 
equivalent to attacking to create an intangible, shimmering, reflective 
illusion in the air within 30 feet. The wand creates a floating, flat, 
square surface that is a perfect mirror on one side and is completely 
transparent on the other. The wielder decides the direction the mirror 
is facing and its size which can be no more than five feet across. 
Objects and creatures can pass through the mirror without issue and 
creatures who investigate the mirror may recognize that it’s an illusion
 and disbelieve it, allowing them to see through the reflective side. On
 his turn if the bearer has not moved yet, he can reduce his speed to 0 
until the end of his turn to cause the mirror to float up to 30 feet in 
any direction or to change the mirror’s direction. The mirror lasts for 
one minute before the illusion fades and the bearer can dismiss it at 
any time with a thought.</p>

that unfolds into small gossamer wings when activated. When first 
donned, the bearer’s mind is slowly filled with a numbing, buzzing noise
 that grows to the edge of an unbearable volume, then abruptly 
disappears. Leaving the bearer with the knowledge of how to activate the
 ring. The bearer can mentally activate the ring as an action equal to 
drawing a weapon, in order to summon a small cloud of 5d20 common 
blowflies in a space he can see within 100 feet. The flies are 
completely mundane insects, capable of eating and reproducing and will 
act as flies normally would under whatever circumstances they arrive in.
 The bearer has no control over the flies and they are no more harmful 
than a typical fly. After the ring has been worn for some time he begins
 to develop an irrational fear of spiders and spider-like monsters, as 
well as a growing preference for consuming offal, rotten food and feces.
 These feelings are noticeable but easily overcome and go away when the 
ring is removed.</p>

barbs, remaining perfect and pure. A creature holding the wand is 
imparted with a strong sense of good and evil and the desire to see 
justice done and the corruption of the world purged away. On the 
wielder’s turn he can target a creature he can see within 60 feet and 
activate the wand as an action equivalent to attacking or casting a

enemy and chime a single pure, piercing note. The wand is perfectly

spells tied to its nature. Whenever the wielder casts a spell that deals
 thunder damage, the caster can choose to cause all targets fully 
affected by the spell to become deafened until the start of the 
wielder’s next turn in addition to the spell’s normal effects. When the 
wand is activated in this way, a loud gonging sound, audible from as far
 as 300 feet, emanates from the wielder.</p>

the tip of a still living archfiend’s horn that seems to suck in the 
ambient light around it. Any intelligent creature who touches the wand 
becomes fully aware of all of its properties, as the archfiend implants 
the offer of an infernal gamble in the bearer’s mind. The devilish deal 
is to cause great harm to the wielder’s enemies in exchange for a 
roughly equivalent portion of the bearer’s life force. As an action 
equivalent to attacking or casting a spell, the wielder can choose a 
target they can see within 60 feet chooses a number (Referred to as X) 
from 1 up to his current hit point total. The target is dealt the 
equivalent of X daggers worth of unblockable hit point damage (Xd4) that
 automatically hits, bypasses any and all forms of damage reduction and 
resistances and cannot be reduced in any way as the wand releases a 
blast of unholy black fires that races unerringly towards the target. If
 this damage would reduce the target to zero hit points or less (See 
Note), the creature and all of its equipment burn down to a smoldering 
pile of black ashes. The wielder is then dealt X daggers worth of 
unblockable hit point damage (Xd4, roll a separate set than the damage 
dealt to the target) that that similarly cannot be reduced in any way, 
as the wielder pays for the archfiend’s power with their life. If the 
damage from the wand would leave the wielder at zero hit points or less,
 the wielder and his equipment (Except for the wand) are completely 
consumed by black flames and his soul becomes the property of the 
archdevil, leaving him unable to be raised from the dead. The use of 
this wand is the same as making a deal (However brief) with a devil and 
may be considered an evil act. There is no limit on how often the wand 
can be used or who can activate it but it cannot be used by an 
unintelligent creature, a being who is under any form of mind control, 
or one without a soul or who cannot sacrifice life energy (Such as 
animals, charmed servants, constructs or undead). —Note: The wand is 
unaffected by spells or abilities that would prevent the target or 
wielder from automatically dying as a result of hit point loss. If the 
wielder has 10 hit points and the wand deals 11 but the wielder has an 
ability to leave themselves at 1 hit point rather than 0 or -1, the 
wielder is still consumed by the wand’s black fire. The archfiend 
bypasses these protections as part of the pact.</p>

old musty books and preserved parchment. The bearer can speak the 
command words “Search Terms” and utter a phrase up to five words in 
length, causing the wand to search for that specific wording in a single
 book within five feet of the bearer. Each appearance of the term will 
be marked by a small slip of paper that materializes between the correct
 pages. Additionally, as an action equivalent to attacking, the wielder 
can target a creature he can see within 30 feet and hiss the command 
word “Shhh!” to cause the creature to be unable to speak above a whisper
 until the end of the bearer’s next turn. Whispering does not hinder 
spellcasting (Unless the spell requires the target to hear the bearer) 
as the target is still able to speak but he cannot provide rallying 
cries to allies, give instructions, shout for help, or yell warnings. 
—Note: In game terms only creatures within five feet of the victim can 
hear him whispering in optimal conditions. During loud situations such 
as combat, thunderstorms or in loud taverns, whispers cannot be heard at
 all.</p>

tongues of crackling rainbow fire. Objects directly touching the 
implement seem to be in a constant flux of aesthetic minor changes in 
color, texture and size, never quite remaining themselves until they 
snap back to their original form upon ceasing contact with the wand. 
When activated, the wielder can feel warped chaotic magic erupt from the
 wand in a maelstrom of elemental energies before finally coalescing 
into a single bolt of power. On the wielder’s turn he can target a 
creature he can see within 60 feet and activate the wand as an action

use and each time the implement is activated the player rolls 1d10 (See 
Note) to determine the type of damage dealt that turn. —Note: Roll 
results on 1d10 are; 1 = Poison, 2 = Fire, 3 = Cold, 4 = Acid, 5 =

feather’s, to that of a hefty war-hammer. Unpredictably growing as large

 basis. Different colors appear and disappear, swirling about within and
 around it, periodically emanating strange weave-like patterns of 
tangled light that are seemingly stuck to it. Knowledgeable PC’s will be

early short of using dispelling or curse breaking magic on the statue. 
As the statue, the bearer is considered a magical object and 
indestructible by non-magical means but spells, magical effects and

effectively creating an untouchable, free floating tube of liquid blood.
 When left unattended or held by a mundane creature, the blood sloshes 
around against the interior of the wand but is otherwise dormant. When 
held by a mage or creature capable of casting magic spells, the blood 
boils in its confined space and the wielder can feel the magic power 
resonating within. Knowledgeable PC’s will realize that the blood

the focus is attuned to. A bearer capable of casting spells can adjust 
the Metamagic formula during the course of a delicate one-hour ritual. 
At the end of the procedure the player rolls a d20 and on a 1, the

spills out all the blood and is destroyed. If the implement survives,
