    <div class="description">
        <h4 class="heading">Description (more info)</h4>
        <div> 
            <p>The first magic weapon a character receives in a video 
game, roleplaying game or a novel is rarely the strongest weapon they 
will come across. As the story progresses they may leave their original 
weapon behind as they move on to stronger enchantments and true 
artifacts of world ending power. Or they may find that their weapon’s 
strength is directly proportional to their own and that as they become 
the hero they were meant to be, their weapon becomes a conduit of that 
potential. Video games in particular have little issue handing out 
breadcrumbs of increasingly powerful magic weapons to allow the player 
to keep up with increasingly difficult enemies and satisfying their 
looting needs. In many RPG settings however there are few mechanical 
ways to make a weapon stronger than normal but weaker than a standard +1
 enchantment. Oftentimes these settings will be plentiful in rich 
descriptions of end game artifact weapons with epic tier abilities, 
while having no lower level unique weapons whatsoever. As the majority 
of campaigns start and take place mostly in the lower levels it means 
that players read about and yearn for these interesting weapons they 
will likely never use. To combat this I’ve drawn on inspiration from 
hundreds of sources to develop a collection of Unique Minor Magic 
Weapons that are scaled down versions of their stronger counterparts. In
 game they can appear as cheap imitations, homages or legacy weapons 
gain in strength with their wielder. These are essentially artifact 
weapons for level 1 characters with all of the charm, mystery and flair 
of their epic level counterparts. They have drawbacks, limitations and 
can relay on the strength of their wielder but can provide the extra 
little bump to turn a TPK into a collective near death experience. These
 unique weapons allow a DM to easily provide a weak but flavorful 
addition to their world.</p>

                <td><p>The Infinite Tentacle: A foul whip crafted from a
 tentacle of an unnatural creature of unknown origin that was severed at
 the tip and imbued with aberrant sorcery. The sinuous tentacle is 
heavily muscled like a long dry tongue covered in irregular blemishes, 
unnatural mottled coloring, small patches of hair and assorted misshapen
 areas of perfectly smooth or heavily calloused skin and tipped with a 
cluster of barbed spines. Although only three feet in length at rest, 
the prehensile limb can stretch as far as it needs to in order to rake 
its barbs across bare flesh and coat itself in the blood of its 
wielder’s foes. Unfortunately, the farther it has to reach, the weaker 
and less precise the attack becomes. The wielder has a typical reach of 
ten feet with the whip but can choose to make an attack with the 
tentacle against any creature that he can see with a clear line of 
sight. If the wielder makes an attack at a target father than 10 feet 
away, the wielder suffers a cumulative -1 penalty on the attack roll’s 
accuracy for each 5 foot increment the target is farther away than 10 
feet. For example, if the creature 30 feet away, the wielder has a -4 on
 their attack roll to hit the target.</p>

                <td><p>B-Flat: A well maintained steel warhammer 
emblazoned with the musical symbol for B-Flat on its wide flat head. The
 weapon makes no noise of any sort when it strikes a target and negates 
any sound the target would make as a result of being hit. Even if the 
wielder took the weapon into both hands and struck a gong as hard as 
they could, the result would only be silence. A creature struck by the 
weapon cannot utter any sounds louder than a barely audible whisper 
until the start of the wielder’s next turn. This does not prevent the 
victim from speaking or casting spell, it only affects the volume of 
their voice. While the warhammer is being wielded and for five minutes 
afterwards, the bearer cannot speak louder than a barely audible 
whisper. This does not hinder spellcasting (Unless the spell requires 
the target to hear the bearer) as the bearer is still able to speak but 
he cannot provide rallying cries to allies, give instructions or shout 
for help. The forced whispering hinders the bearer’s ability to properly
 project their personality and they suffer disadvantage on all charisma 
based checks that rely on them speaking. —Note: In game terms only 
creatures within five feet of the victim can hear him whispering in 
optimal conditions. During loud situations such as combat, thunderstorms
 or in a loud taverns, whispers cannot be heard at all.</p>

                <td><p>Aurum: A greatsword that is a masterwork of form 
and function. The hilt and cross-guard is crafted from bronze and 
polished ivory, forming the outstretched wings of an angel. Between the 
wings, set into the base of the blade on both sides, rubies the size of a
 mortal man’s eyes have been cut and shaped into crimson teardrops. The 
blade itself is forged of adamantite stained gold, with High Gothic 
runes hand-scribed along the weapon’s length detailing a long and 
illustrious lineage of fallen foes. The weapon’s kiss is death, a 
ravaging energy field surrounds the blade, tearing apart solid matter 
with every strike. Whenever the player rolls to determine the weapon’s 
damage, he may roll the weapon’s damage die twice and choose either 
result to use. —Note: This only affects the weapon’s damage itself and 
not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine 
smite or spell effects.</p>

inlaid with shining blue runes. The back of the hammer’s head looks like
 the tusks and trunk of a ferocious bull elephant. The weapon feels 
slightly heavier than normal as if its weight was slightly unbalanced to
 favour its business end. This quirk of the design allows the wielder’s 
blow to potentially smash through multiple foes at a time on 
particularly lethal blows. Once per turn, on the wielder’s turn, when he
 scores a critical hit with the weapon or reduces a creature to 0 hit 
points with it, the wielder can immediately make an additional attack 
with the weapon against a creature within reach.  </p>

spiked metal wire (Mace statistics) and covered in viscera that never 
cleans off. A creature in possession of the weapon feels a certain kind 
of romantic attraction to it and treats it as though it was a person as 
well as a weapon.  The wielder develops a deep hatred of undead and 
believes them to be a threat to the club and the weapon is treated as +1
 against undead creatures.</p>

long as the wielder is tall. The axe’s head itself is similarly large, 
shaped like that of a huge wood-axe, but ornately engraved with leaves 
and scrolls and inlaid with gold. The wielder feels a deep and strong 
connection to the natural world and develops an emotional attachment to 
the supernatural creatures who guard the earth from those who would 
abuse and corrupt it. The wielder is filled with a sense of reverence 
and utmost respect for the wilderness and the weapon functions as a +1 
if the wielder has never personally cut down (Or directly aided in 
cutting down) a healthy living tree in his life.</p>

entirely of obsidian, its shape cruel and savage as if ripped from 
poisoned stone by obscene claws. Knowledgeable PC’s will be able to 
identify the material as rock taken from Dread Mountain, a profoundly 
unhallowed place whose active reaches so deep into the earth that is 
draws tainted magma up from the very edges of the highest circle of 
hell. The corrupted rock releases a miasma of polluted air that slowly 
corrodes nearby metal, petrifies wood and stings the skin. Particularly 
impressive blows create hairline fractures in the stone, releasing 
pockets of trapped volcanic air that spew outward dissolving the 
target’s flesh, leaving caustic, chemically burned wounds that reek of 
acerbic solvents. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit, the 
greataxe releases a caustic burst dealing additional acid damage 
equivalent to a shortsword (1d6) to the target and all enemies within 
five feet of to the target.</p>

white marble like material, with a thin blade that sings like a flame in
 the wind when swung. The handle is warm to the touch and the blade 
searing to the flesh. When the wielder speaks the command word (The name
 of the weapon; Azerian), the blade bursts into flames, shedding light 
equivalent to a torch and dealing one additional point of fire damage on
 each successful attack. Speaking the command word a second time snuff 
the flames.</p>

                <td><p>Battle Aspergillum: A heavy mace whose grip is 
emblazoned with the holy symbol of the God of Random Domain. The weapon 
sports eight steel flanges allowing for the greater penetration of plate
 armor and the utter devastation of those clad in less than that. The 
weapon’s true power though does not come from its physical qualities but
 by its ability to act as a vessel and conduit of divine power. Within 
the interior of the mace’s head rests a reservoir capable of storing 
holy or unholy water. The bearer can pour the contents of one vial of 
holy or unholy water into the aspergillum’s head (As an action 
equivalent to making an attack) which fills the reservoir. Whenever the 
wielder successfully attacks a creature, he can press a button on the 
shaft, causing tiny holes to open on the mace’s head, dousing the struck
 creature with the reservoir of holy or unholy water. While reservoir is
 filled with sacred or profane water, the wielder can utter a brief 
prayer to the God the mace is decorated with, who takes the liquid as an
 offering and blesses the weapon with divine power. The wielder can pray
 as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, which consumes the water 
within the reservoir and for the next minute whenever the wielder 
successfully strikes a target, he inflicts radiant or necrotic damage 
(For holy and unholy water respectively) equivalent to a dagger (1d4) in
 addition to the attack’s damage. This additional damage is not 
multiplied on a critical hit. The weapon is designed to hold water and 
is not designed to hold flammable oil, acid, poison or other alchemical 
materials and will not function if filled with them.</p>

containing 5d6 sling bullets. To the untrained eye the small, rough 
steel balls appears to fairly mundane, but careful observation reveals 
tiny holes dotting its surface that lead to a conductive crystal core 
that holds explosive arcane power. Upon contact with their target’s the 
bullets explode in a concussive blast of evocation magic. Whenever the 
wielder successfully attacks a target, he inflicts force damage 
equivalent to a dagger (1d4) to the target and all creatures within five
 feet of the target. This force damage is in addition to the attack’s 
damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

longspear, its rowanwood shaft ornamented with brass and black iron. The
 blade of the weapon is long and shaped like a wickedly sharp prism 
while its tang is sunk into a black iron socket. The weapon’s head 
gleams with an impossibly reflective surface, like a crystal formed of a
 mirror’s glass. The fey’s blessing on the spear causes particular 
devastation to the unnatural undead and vile shapechangers and the 
weapon is treated as a +1 against such creatures. The spear has the 
vaguest hint of clairvoyant sentience and refuses to be wielded by those
 who its been sworn to destroy. Shapechangers and creatures who have 
been voluntarily shape changed in the last year (Typically through 
polymorphing or wildshaping magic) as well as undead and creatures who 
have ever summoned, created or raised undead are never considered 
proficient with Blind Reflection.</p>

milky steel, its grip wrapped in black snakeskin and its guard worked 
into the shape of briars and mandrake plants. The pommel-nut is a 
slightly-pointed dome of buttery-yellow amber, like a mandrake fruit. In
 combat the wielder feels the primal energy of unmitigated rage flood 
through their mind and can choose to throw aside all concern for defense
 to attack with fierce desperation. When the wielder makes their first 
attack on his turn he may choose to attack recklessly which gives him 
advantage on all attacks made with the weapon during this turn but all 
attack rolls made against him have advantage until the start of the his 
next turn. When this ability is activated Bloodflower’s blade turns 
crimson and seems to drip blood. The sight of humanoids causes a primal 
frenzy to stir in the back of the bearer’s mind. Whenever the wielder 
attacks a humanoid he must always choose to use the weapon to attack 
recklessly regardless of the risk to himself.</p>

attack roll, the thorns are unable to turn in time and deal damage

bears a connection to its bearer wishing to protect and provide for him.
 During combat if the wielder has not moved yet on his turn, he can 
plant his feet firmly on the ground and take up a defensive position 
which causes his speed to drop to 0 until the end of his turn. While in 
this stance, the wielder brandishes an impenetrable ticket of razor 
sharp thorns and is able to make an attack of opportunity with the pike 
against an enemy that enters his reach and if that attack is successful,
 the creature’s speed drop to 0 until the end of the turn. The defensive
 position ends if the wielder moves, attacks or at the start of the 
wielder’s next turn. Once per day, if Bramble is planted in the ground 
in full sunlight for one hour and at least a liter of water is poured at
 its base, the pike’s many flowers self-pollinate, turning into dozens 
of large, luscious blackberries that can be picked and eaten, providing

 is so filled with evocation magic that it is prone to overheating and

the grip’s skeletal fingers to animate, wrap themselves around one of 
the wielder’s fists and claw into the skin of his hand, creating an 
unnatural union of sword and flesh. This process takes an action

of pressure but no actual pain and takes no damage as the material 
penetrates the skin, forcing it to remain grasped to the handle. While 
joined with the wielder, the blade’s perverse energies deal unnatural

is considered necrotic damage rather than slashing. While attached, the 
weapon cannot be released or disarmed and the wielder cannot use that 
hand for tasks requiring any sort of manual dexterity as the hand is

 the wielder can spend one minute cutting and prying away the fused 
areas, suffering two hit points of damage per character level (Or 20% of
 his maximum health or other equivalent amount), or he can take an 
action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell and use a free hand to
 rip it off by force, dealing twice that amount of damage to himself due

itself have been shaped into the likeness of a great oak tree, with 
small emeralds embedded into the branches as if to portray leaves, and a
 large, spherical aquamarine grasped within its roots. When the tip of 
the blade is held near to the ground, this aquamarine begins to glow, 
growing brighter the nearer to the ground the blade tips. The wielder is
 filled with a sense of reverence and utmost respect for the wilderness 
and the weapon functions as a +1 if the wielder has never personally cut
 down (Or directly aided in cutting down) a healthy living tree in his 
life. Whenever a living creature is killed with Fandalurian, the 
aquamarine in its pommel gleams brightly, and a small tree sprouts from 
the slain creature, taking root in its final resting place.</p>

against the handle, there is a golden-bronze metallic inlay.  The rest 
of the bow is a curved, verdant green, jungle vine texture as if 
building on itself in a series of natural leaf scales. Whenever an arrow
 is nocked it takes no strength to pull back the string as if the bow 
itself is doing all the work. Arrows fly off at an incredible speed when
 shot and the bow flexes forward with such intensity that it makes a 
roaring whooshing sound. Twice per day before making an attack, the 
wielder can choose to activate the bow’s natural druidic magic, 
potentially entangling the target. If the attack hits, dozens of 
brambles burst from the arrow’s wooden shaft, wrapping around the target
 who becomes restrained by the hard, thorny vines. In addition to the 
arrow’s wound, the target suffers piercing damage equivalent to a dagger
 (1D4) and is restrained as if caught in a standard weighted net.</p>

 to extinguish itself at will. Only the wielder is able to perceive the 
light, all other creatures see no additional illumination. Twice per day
 as an action equivalent to making an attack, the wielder can launch a 
firebolt from the dagger as a target it can see within 60 feet. To hit 
the wielder must make an attack roll as if attacking with the dagger vs

of a summer’s day and the blade is perpetually engulfed in a hazy heat 
mirage. Twice per day as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the 
wielder may grasp the bare blade, or press their thumb against a tiny 
barb tucked into the hilt dealing damage to himself equal to a dagger 
(1d4). When blood is drawn, the wielder shifts in a shimmering heat 
wave, teleporting up to fifteen feet away to an empty space that he can 
see and leaving behind a perfect illusory duplicate of the wielder in 
the space he left. The duplicate copies the wielder’s movements and 
moves as though it was the real thing. The illusion lasts until it takes

 it fades away.</p>

choose to have the player roll on my homebrew tables of effects on this 
blog, the published Sorcerer’s Wild Magic Surge table or any other

take a moment and attempt to deescalate the situation, hopefully 
resolving the fight without overt bloodshed while simultaneously 
preparing for that grim eventuality. When initiative is rolled, the 
bearer can forgo his roll and instead choose to go last in the 
initiative order out of all creatures involved, causing the mace to 
frost over. When the bearer activates this power his breath becomes cold
 and icy as he gains the ability to chill his hot-blooded enemies. At 
the start of each of his turns during that combat the bearer can attempt
 (As a free action) to persuade, intimidate or bluff other creatures in 
combat to surrender, escape or follow an otherwise peaceful course of 
action and gains advantage on that roll. Those that refuse a peaceful 
option have accepted the consequences and when the wielder has chosen to
 go last in combat and has offered his foes a non lethal solution, the 
mace is treated as a +1 until the end of the fight.  </p>

discharges small static shocks on a regular basis and when held, the 
wielder’s hair stands on end and small arcs of electricity to jump 
between fingers and strands of hair. When actively being used in combat,
 the electricity charges and discharges faster as the weapon audible 
crackles and violently sparks. The weapon’s conductive nature directs 
lethal jolts of power directly into the target’s body, shocking the 
delicate nervous system and leaving smoking, flash burned skin. Half of 
the damage dealt by the pike is considered lighting damage while the 
rest is normal for its type. Whenever the wielder brings a creature to 0
 hit points or kills a creature with a blow from the spiked chain, any 
damage in excess of that needed to kill or down the creature surges in 
the corpse and can be redirected. The wielder can immediately choose 
another creature he can see within 30 feet of the dead creature and 
launch a bolt of electricity at them which automatically hits, dealing 
lighting damage equal to the amount of damage left over after bringing 
the original target to 0 hit points. If this lighting bolt kills the 
second target, the wielder may repeat the process on a third target 
(Then forth, fifth, etc) until there is no more excess damage. —Note: A 
combat example: The wielder hits a near death creature who has 5 hit 
points, and deals 20 damage. The creature dies at 0 hp and the wilder 
directs a lighting bolt dealing 15 damage at another wounded creature 
who has 10 hp remaining. The second creature also dies and the wielder 
directs another lighting bolt at a third creature which deals 5 damage, 
leaving the third target injured but alive.</p>

able to repeatedly guide the weapon to strike the exact same location, 
causing increasing amounts of damage. Whenever the wielder attacks, each
 hit against a singular target deals additional damage equal to the

hook. Certain talismans made of fine jewels are designed to attach to 
such a hook. The simple movement of a single pure gem within the cage of
 the flanges creates a heavy tolling, like the bells of doom. If a 
certain type of gem with a value of at least 100 gold pieces is set 
within Ironheart, half of the damage dealt by the mace is considered the
 corresponding damage type (See Note) while the rest is normal for its 
type. The mace’s magic draws upon the different classes of precious 
stones in unique ways, allowing the wielder to switch between talismans 
for different effects. Changing out one of the gems within Ironheart for
 another requires a free hand and an action equivalent to making an 
attack or casting a spell. When the mace is set with a precious enough 
stone and is used to land a killing blow on a living creature, the 
weapon emits a deep loud reverberation and heavy tones remind all those 
who hear it of the fleeting nature of life and their own mortality. The 
wielder can then lock eyes with any living creature within 60 feet and 
cause them to become frightened of the wielder until the end of that

 a massive and yet surprisingly maneuverable weapon. Simply ornamented, 
the sword’s hilt is wrapped in white wolfskin, the pommel a heavy ring 
and down the blade runs a series of etchings that resemble a lacework of
 frost. The wielder experiences a strange unnatural calm while holding 
the blackened talon, as if all of their empathy, hatred, compassion, 
rage and all their strongest emotions were locked away behind a frozen 
wall of objective reason. The wielder acts with brutal rationalism and 
callous logical reasoning which makes them a nightmarish opponent on the
 battlefield but an unfeeling sociopath in casual conversation. The 
wielder is able to use the abominable looking weapon in ways a person 
with even a drop of compassion never would, manipulating the blade to 
great effect, landing cruel, maiming strikes. Twice per day when the 
wielder successfully attacks, the player may select any single rolled 
damage die of his choosing (See Note) and that die will be considered to
 have rolled the maximum possible result for that type of die instead of
 the current result. This must be done after damage is rolled but before

bearer’s nose only pick up the scent of freshly turned earth and mildew.
 At exactly midnight each night, creatures within earshot of the pickaxe
 will hear the sound of the blade being dragged across a whetstone 
emanating from this weapon as it sharpens itself to a well-honed point.

lubricant and afterwards an observer will notice that the weapon

 hot knife through butter. The supernatural maintenance wears down

 reverts to a respectably sharpened head. After the weapon prepares 
itself at midnight, the next two successful attacks made with it are 
treated as if the weapon damage dice rolled the maximum amount possible.
 Afterwards the damage is rolled normally until the pickaxe can sharpen

purpose. The crossguard is set with black horn, the hilt in ivory and

great horn. Knowledgeable PC’s will know that the namesake of this

nonmagical weapons. Pale Soul’s bearer may also use the scepter to 
perceive incorporeal undead and intangible entities within a 100 foot

slightly curved, with a curving sharpened spur at the root of the blade.
 The blade’s blued surface is ragged with streaks of cinnabar like 
streaks of lightning; the quillons and pommel-nut are simple bronze, the
 grip wrapped in the hide of a tiger. When the weapon is used to land a 
killing blow on a living creature, the sword emits a deep loud 
reverberation just like a large gong or heavy bell. The heavy tones 
remind all those who hear it of the fleeting nature of life and their 
own mortality. The wielder can then lock eyes with any living creature 
within 60 feet and cause them to become frightened of the wielder until 
the start of the wielder’s next turn.</p>

 As soon as the wielder gazes at it for more than a few seconds, he 
notices that the wrappings are actually quite pristine, and the wood is a
 fresh, light brown. After holding it for a full minute, the wielder can
 see thin metal bands along the outer length of the arms that end in 
tiny purple stones, while the string takes on a pearlescent sheen. The 
wielder’s sense of focus and awareness are heightened while holding the 
bow and he gains an instinctual feel for placing accurate shots on small
 targets. The wielder is able to see in dim light as easily as bright 
light and when attacking, the All Seer ignores the any benefits the 
target may have for half cover and three-quarters cover. Knowledgeable 
PC’s know that the All Seer has popped up from time to time throughout 
history, seldom within the same century, and never in the same hands. It
 is reputed to have been used to achieve several impossible shots and 
deeds of note. No-one knows how, why or when it was made.</p>

 of the axe appears like nothing so much as a phoenix taking flight, its
 wings the blades and its feathers the serrated edges of the Axe. In its
 talons the firebird grasps a zendalure gem of indeterminate value. 
Finally, there is a large king’s tear gem set at the very tip of the 
axe, grasped by a tiny hand. Knowledgeable PC’s are aware that this is a
 historic weapon passed down a long line or martial Emperors who could 
always be found fighting at the frontlines of their armies. A creature 
holding the weapon experiences the feeling that they are being watched 
and judged by the spirits of those who wielded the weapon before him. A 
bearer may spend ten minutes paying homage to the spirits by humbling 
himself and making a token sacrifice of his pride by completely shaving 
his head and face, honouring the previous wielders and asking for their 
guidance. Once the ceremony is finished the spirits grant their blessing
 and the greataxe is treated as a +1 for the next eight hours for that 
bearer only. The bearer must wait at least ten days until they have long
 enough hair to re-enact the ritual to the spirits satisfaction.</p>

in human sinew and small bone spikes jut from the skull’s empty eye 
sockets which serve no practical purpose other than to add to its 
intimidating look. When the weapon is used to kill, it leaves a seed of 
necromantic energy in the resulting corpse. This spark of unholy flame 
can be fanned by conventional necromantic spells if they are cast before
 the black fire burns itself out. A living creature dealt a killing blow
 by this weapon, only needs half of the costly material components (Such
 as onyx gems, rare incense or diamonds) that the spell requires need in
 order to raise it as an undead creature. This benefit lasts for one 
hour after the creature is killed, after which it requires the normal 
amount of materials. Any undead creature animated during this one hour 
timeframe is considered proficient with The Dead Sword and treats it as a
 +1 longsword. —Note: For example, if Animate Dead is cast on a corpse 
and it would normally need an onyx gem worth 50 gp, The Dead Sword’s 
enchantment reduces that cost to a gem worth only 25 gp for one hour

 nightmare, a Flesh Grinder is alive with malevolence, filled with an 
unspeakable thirst for blood and flesh. The weapon was born in the 
bowels of the Abyss, fashioned by demonic hands and infused with all the
 hate, bile, and violence bubbling up from that dire realm. It has the 
general size and shape of a greataxe, but in place of a smooth cutting 
edge, it has a toothy row of jagged barbs. Old blood mixed with dark 
grease oozes from the barbs, and when the weapon is swung in battle, the
 serrated edge rocks back and forth to chew through flesh and bone, 
spewing noxious smoke into the air. The wielder can never use the weapon
 to inflict non-lethal / stun damage and if the wielder deals enough 
damage to be given the choice to render a target unconscious or kill 
them, he must choose to kill the enemy. Twice per day when Fleshgrinder 
bites into a creature, the wielder can activate its demonic power 
causing it to release a billowing cloud of smoke that fills a five foot 
square with dense black mist. The creature’s space becomes engulfed in 
the opaque vapour and he is effectively blinded but also gains full 
cover from outside attacks. The dark fog is harmless, causing no injury 
and dissipating completely at the start of the wielder’s next turn. 
Whenever the player rolls the maximum result on Fleshgrinder’s damage 
die (See Note), they can roll that die an additional time and add both 
results to the total damage dealt. This ability can trigger multiple

shaped handle with glistening red rubies set into the serpent’s eyes. 
Each swing of the opulent weapon releases a spray of sand in the blade’s
 wake and whenever the khopesh slices open flesh, the victim leaks sand 
instead of blood. This weapon was forged for the personal bodyguard of 
the mighty pharaoh and created so that the Godking would never have only
 a single guard. Once per day the wielder when the wielder successfully 
attacks a living creature, the he can choose to summon a gritty defender
 of the Pharaoh’s will, blessing the air and sand with life as the 
weapon’s mystical energies gives birth to a miniature sandstorm. The 
wild elemental follows the wielder’s mental commands (See Note) and 
feeds on the sand-turned-blood the khopesh draws forth from its enemies.
 Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a living creature and the 
sandstorm is with five feet of the target, the elemental regains hit 
points equivalent to a dagger’s damage (1d4). The sandstorm’s form is 
unstable and it disperses into pile of inanimate sand one minute after 
it is summoned or last regained hit points. —Note: The sandstorm acts on
 the turn immediately after the wielder and the DM can use wolf 
statistics for the elemental’s equivalent statistics for hit points,

silk that bear small marks like tiny bloodstains, and the smooth simple 
finial that tips its pommel is golden. The rapier is pristine and any 
blood that touches the weapon is immediately absorbed into itself,

creature (See Note) and remains there for at least one uninterrupted 
hour, it is treated as a +1 for eight hours after being withdrawn from

moisture from the corpse leaving it a desiccated husk when it is

circulatory system while alive. The DM’s has discretion on what corpses

 curving lines cover the surface of the silver blade, giving it a 
feather-like motif and a light breeze constantly surrounds it. The 
entire weapon is a masterpiece of flowing graceful design, delicately 
ornate scrollwork and is a tribute to those who made it. Running along 
its length is a poem written in iambic pentameter, penned in Auran, the 
language of the creatures of the air. Those who are able to read it, 
discover it is not much more than a limerick disparaging the filthy land
 bound creatures and extolling the virtues of those that can fly. The 
verses have particularly harsh words to say about the incompetence and 
clumsiness of “groundhogs” and how that in contrast, those that can take
 to the air are naturally adept in all ways. Any creature who does not 
have a natural fly speed who wields the weapon finds that they are 
slightly less proficient than usual at completing their normal everyday 
task, as if the poem was a warning rather than boast. The rapier is 
treated as a +1, but while the weapon is being wielded and for one hour 
afterwards, a bearer without a natural fly speed suffers a penalty of -1
 on all of his skill checks.</p>

in translucent silk that hums with a latent energy. Every sunrise, 2d4 
arrows with slim golden shafts, delicate fletching and razor sharp, 
barbed heads materialize within it. The quiver holds thirty arrows at 
capacity and when full, will not create more. The bright arrows 
evaporate into wisps of sunlight and fire if they remain outside the 
quiver for more than ten minutes or after they are shot from a bow. The 
quiver holds a spark of divine essence which fuels the arrows daily 
creation. The arrows themselves retain just enough magical power to be 
considered a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming resistances, 
damage reduction and other defenses. The keen heads of arrows curl 
backwards into cruel barbed points that can tear into the victim’s 
flesh. The barbs are not guaranteed to hook in and it’s more chance than
 skill to land such a debilitating shot. On a successful attack with an 
ebony arrow, when the player rolls the damage die he must roll a second 
confirming die of the same sort. If the second die is the same result as
 the first, the player adds both dice to the total damage rolled. —Note:
 Combat example: The wielder attacked with a longbow, hits and rolls 1d8
 damage. The first damage die (1d8) is an 8 and the confirming die (Also
 1d8) is also an 8. Since the rolls match, the wielder deals 16 damage 
instead of 8. If the confirming die had a result of 1-7, the wielder 
would deal the original 8 damage. This only affects the weapon’s damage 
itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, 
divine smite or spell effects. I recommend that the player or DM assign a
 color system so avoid confusion, for example the first die is always 
blue and the confirming die is always red. This way both dice can be 
rolled at the same time to speed the process along.</p>

black dragon bone. The weapon flickers with jolts of power (Never 
harmful or distracting to the bearer) and discharges small static shocks
 on a regular basis and when held this property extends to the bearer as
 well, causing their hair to stand on end and small arcs of electricity 
to jump between fingers and strands of hair. When actively being used in
 combat, the electricity charges and discharges faster as the sword

hilt into a large holy symbol of the God of Purity. No matter its 
circumstances, the weapon remains absolutely pristine, free of nicks, 
dents, stains, blood, gore and dirt, remaining perfect and pure. When 
held, the bearer’s mind is filled with thoughts of purification, 
righteous vindication and cleansing fire. The wielder is imparted with a
 strong sense of good and evil, the desire to see justice done at any 
cost and for the corruption of the world purge by the sword.  The 
longsword impervious to mundane damage and never breaks, chips or dulls 
as a result of casual use and is all but impossible to break or damage 
as a result of combat, even when targeted by enemies who attempt 
sundering or weapon breaking techniques. If the weapon is used to slay 
humanoid creature, the Sword of Justification will cause the corpse to 
undergo a gruesome metamorphosis. It will contort itself into monstrous 
shapes, growing horns, fur, spikes tentacles or fangs, oozing black 
blood, and reeking of sulfur and brimstone. The specific shape varies 
randomly, but no one looking at the result will imagine it was anything 
but an evil creature and the original victim will be all but 
unrecognizable. This is a permanent physical change that can be undone 
with abilities that dispel magic or break curses. Knowledgeable PC’s 
will have heard that these swords are sometimes carried by fervent 
members of holy inquisitions who use them to justify the evil hiding 
inside the innocent civilians that got in their way and ended up dead.  </p>

enameled over in translucent, glassy crimson. Its broad, chisel-like 
head is of the same steel and carved with intricate channels; the 
razored edges seem perpetually wet with blood which sprays from the 
weapon in gleaming teardrops when used in combat. The weapon saps its 
wielder’s vitality but pays back the price in combat with each 
successful strike. After successfully attacking the target but before 
rolling damage, the wielder must choose to sacrifice a number of hit 
points up to one hit point per character level (Minimum 1, or up to 10% 
of maximum health or other equivalent amount,) in order to deal 
additional damage to the target, equal to twice the amount sacrificed. 
This damage is considered the same type as the weapon’s attack and is 
added together with the rolled damage. The sacrificed hit points cannot 
be reduced in any way but the health can be regained as normal. Tears of
 Blood draws out a portion of the victim’s life and feeds it to its 
wielder when enough blood is spilled. Whenever the wielder kills or 
scores a critical hit on a living enemy he regains hit points equivalent
 to a dagger (1d4).</p>

substance; either eternal ice or impossibly translucent blue-white 
embers. A corona of roiling white flames dances endlessly across the 
blades, warming and cooling all at once, though Snowember deals no

weapon was repaired with metals sourced from other swords and its blade 
is not dissimilar to a patchwork quilted cloak with countless signs 
where it has been broken, sheered or shattered and reforged rather than 
tossed aside. When swung, Manyblade leaves faint afterimages of other 
longswords as if the blade’s metal carries the memories of all of the 
past weapons that form its length. Twice per day when the wielder missed
 with an attack roll, he can focus on the afterimages forcing them to 
coalesce into physical form for an instant, guaranteeing one of the 
blades to catch the unsuspecting target off-guard which deals force 
damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4). The attack is still considered a

levering points to unbalance and reposition even the sturdiest of his

in its design, a smooth metal dome protects the wielder’s hands from 
incoming strikes. The weapon is imbued with a fragment of skill source 
from an unusually petite half-elf duellist named Sasha Orellum. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard stories that her short arms always 
placed her at a disadvantage against her long-limbed opponents and as 
she couldn’t reach her opponent’s chest before getting hit, she’d aim 
for the next best thing: their hands. Sasha honed her skills, inventing a
 fighting style that focused entirely on disarming her foes and became a
 grand-master fencer in her own right. Using an action equivalent to 
making an attack or casting a spell, the wielder can attempt to disarm 
an opponent. The wielder gains advantage on the disarming roll or the 
target suffers disadvantage to resist the attempt, whichever is better 
for the wielder. Whenever the wielder lands a critical hit, he can 
immediately attempt to disarm the target as a free action. Whenever the 
wielder disarm’s a creature, he is able to slash along the target’s 
wrists or hands dealing damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4). —Note: If 
your system doesn’t have rules for disarm attempts use this: The wielder
 declares the disarm attempt and chooses to make either a Strength or 
Dexterity check which is contested against the target’s Strength or 
Dexterity check (Target chooses which ability it uses). If the wielder 
has the higher result, the target is disarmed of one object they’re 
holding. If the target wins the contest, there is no effect and the 
action is consumed without effect.</p>

kinetic force with each swing and it begins to hum with power after a 
few successful impacts in the heat of combat. Devastatingly strong hits,
 overcharge the mace causing it to explode outward in an explosion of 
shrapnel and arcane energy before the shards are quickly pulled back in 
reforming the mace’s head. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit,

hole in the air, as if one was staring into the sky on a moonless, 
starless night. The weapon has its own weak, but constant gravitational 
pull, drawing objects, creatures and even light towards the void that 
serves as a blade. The bearer and all creatures within five feet of him 
have their movement speed reduced by five feet as the gravitational 
field hampers their mobility. Whenever a creature is slain by the 
weapon, the corpse is stretched and compressed into long thin strips of 
spaghetti-like substance that is drawn in and absorbed into the sword, 
utterly disappearing leaving nothing (Including equipment) behind. The 
Shard is a double edged sword and should the bearer be killed while 
wielding the weapon, his body and possessions (Other than the sword 
itself) are likewise thinned and squeezed into ribbons of dense matter 
before being consumed by the blade’s power. The wielder can never use 
the sword to inflict non-lethal / stun damage and if the wielder deals

kill them, he must choose to kill the enemy.</p>
