        <div> 
            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

slippers, bedecked with scintillating fish scales. The slippers allow 
the bearer to walk on calm water no more than three feet deep as if it 
were solid ground. The water’s current (If any) will carry the bearer 
along as if the ground were moving under their feet. Rushing torrents, 
rough seas and rapids are difficult and hazardous footing that will dump
 the bearer in the water if he is not careful. If the water is more than
 three feet deep, the slippers instantly cease to function until the 
bearer returns to the shallows.</p>

 steel manacles that are a light as a feather and don’t restrict 
movement in any way. The chain that connects the two wrist manacles is 
illusionary and will always be just long enough to connect the two 
halves. The chain will not pass through other objects and creates 
clanking and tinkling sounds appropriate to the chain’s movement. The 
bearer can cause the chain to appear or disappear at will with a single 
thought. Extremely perceptive PC’s who are actively paying attention, 
will notice that the bearer’s arms don’t seem to be affected by the 
weight of the manacles and chain and may suspect something. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize this item as being very common with 
stage magicians and illusionists but have become more common with 
freedom fighters who infiltrate mines, plantations and chain gangs to 
start rebellions with these manacles in order to blend in without 
becoming trapped themselves.</p>

with intricate carvings that vaguely resembles a planetary globe. A thin
 seam runs along the equator of the sphere and turning the two halves of
 the sphere in opposite directions along the seam, causes it to shatter 
into dozens of pieces, revealing a small imp trapped inside. The demon 
will answer one geographical question posed by the creature who broke 
the globe. The imp will always answer truthfully (The imp is extremely 
well knowledgeable in the field of geography including the outer planes)
 but will make attempts to mislead the user by exploiting loopholes in 
the grammar of poorly crafted questions. After answering a question, the
 imp begins to gather the pieces and reassembles the sphere from the 
inside, trapping itself upon its completion. The sphere can be broken in
 this fashion only once per day.</p>

amulet in the shape of an arachnid, consisting mainly of chitin held 
together with webbing, while the cord is made of braided spider silk. 
While worn, the bearer is instinctively aware of the exact position of 
any spiders within 30 feet. The bearer also receives faint unnerving 
tinglings on the back of his neck that warn of imminent dangers, 
allowing him to instantly react, granting a +1 on initiative rolls.</p>

                <td><p>Instrumental Amulet: A brass pendant cut from a 
cymbal in the shape of a musical note with its sharp edges bound in drum
 skin. The amulet is strung on a braided cord of lute strings, violin 
strings and piano wire. The pendant will only function for bearer it 
recognizes as true musicians and to utilize its magic, the bearer must 
be proficient in at least one instrument of any kind, from a slide 
whistle to an orchestral harp. If the bearer concentrates for a moment 
and focuses on the musical tones of a specific instrument, they can 
summon it into their waiting hands. The medallion can create any 
functional, standard looking, one or two handed instrument capable of 
being carried. The summoned creation has very little weight and physical
 substance (This does not affect how it plays or sounds) and disappears 
if it’s used as a weapon or tool, if it takes any damage, the bearer 
creates a second instrument or spends more than a single round not being
 held by the bearer. Once per week the bearer may mediate in silence and
 focus on the pendant for one hour in order to hear musical notes made 
by a Random Musical Instrument they’ve never heard before. After hearing
 the notes through meditation, the bearer can summon the instrument 
normally and begin learning to play it. Knowledgeable PC’s will have 
heard of these items being given to journeyman bards, gleemen, and 
traveling musicians to allow them to summon and practice with whatever 
instrument they feel like on their travels in order to broaden their 
skill set. Some treat it as a test of their profession that they are 
only allowed to leave their master’s tutelage when the medallion 
considers them proficient. —Note: A well traveled adult bearer such as 
most PCs will no doubt have heard songs played on dozens of different 
musical instruments. You can refer to the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9697/">Random Musical Instruments</a> table in order to get a large selection of objects the bearer could have heard and therefore summon.</p>

fits in any lock but rarely turns the mechanism. There is a 10% chance 
that every time the key is placed in a lock it hasn’t already been 
placed in, it turns and unlocks the object. The key can never be used to
 lock objects.</p>

long leather strap with steel weights on the ends. Placing this bookmark
 in a closed book and twisting the loose ends together causes the book 
(And the bookmark) to turn completely invisible. The book is invisible 
to all creatures except for the one who connected the loose ends. The 
book becomes visible again if the ends are disconnected by any creature.
 The bookmark can be activated and deactivated as often as possible. 
These objects are prized by mages and spies to keep their spellbooks and
 cipher code books secret and secure.</p>

 worn, prevents the bearer from ever suffering from eye strain due to 
reading. The bearer can also spend a moment looking around in order to 
become aware of which creature within a 15 foot-radius of himself is the
 most intelligent (Has the highest intelligence score).  </p>

                <td><p>Bracers of Polarity. A pair of bracers that could
 not be more differing in their physical appearance. One is big and 
heavy, covered in raised patterns of hard angles and made of a rough 
black leather. The other is petite and nearly weightless, mostly 
featureless with the occasional delicate whorls that were pressed into 
the soft white leather. The bracer’s represent a magical balance of 
extremes and pass that concept on to a creature who wears both of them. 
Whenever the bearer makes a damage roll (Whether by a weapon,spell or 
other effect), treat any die roll result of half or less as a “1” and 
any result higher than half of the maximum as having rolled the maximum.
 Wearing only one bracer disrupts the balance and grants no special 
effect. Any magical or supernatural effects that allows the bearer to 
reroll damage rolls, disrupts the delicate magic and prevents the 
bracers from functioning., however mundane abilities gained from 
training or physical skill can still be used in conjunction with the 
bracers. —Note: An example of this effect: The bearer hits with a 
greatsword and rolls 2d6 for damage. He rolls a 3 and a 4, which the 
bracers balance into a final result of a 1 and a 6.</p>

                <td><p>Holdout Ring, Dagger: A small, cheap, easily 
overlooked, iron ring with an etching of a dagger on the inside of the 
band. This ring functions as a seldom used, last line of defense for the
 desperate and unarmed or as an “Ace in the hole” for tricksters and 
roguish types who may call upon it regularly. The bearer can activate 
the ring with a single thought with causes the ring to instantly 
transform into a steel dagger which is automatically held in the hand 
the ring was on (It falls to the ground if the bearer is unable to hold 
the dagger for any reason). The transformation is instantaneous, 
allowing the bearer to activate the magic and attack with the weapon all
 in one fluid motion. The dagger will automatically revert back into its
 ring form after 24 hours passes. The ring is protected by minor 
shielding wards and when worn by a living creature it does not give off a
 magical aura and is not detectable as a magical object.</p>

painted with symbols of intelligence, knowledge and communication which 
contains five blocks of incense. While a block of this sweet-scented 
incense burns, creatures inhaling its fumes become unusually receptive 
to the thoughts and ideas of others. In still air the smoke permeates a 
20 foot cube and all creatures within the area can communicate 
telepathically with each other. Creatures communicating in this fashion 
don’t need to share a language but must be intelligent enough to speak a
 single language. A single block of incense burns for one hour and if 
extinguished the remaining incense loses effectiveness.</p>

fine, emerald green powder. When sprinkled over a fire, a creature may 
step into the flames without being harmed and can teleport to another 
fire they are aware of within 100 feet. The fire must be large enough 
for the creature to reasonable pass through it, typically being as wide 
as the creature’s shoulders. There’s enough powder for 2d4+1 uses and 
only one creature can be transported per use.</p>

                <td><p>Gasping Lace:A black lace choker necklace with a 
blood red garnet hanging from it. The lace fit tightly but comfortably 
around the neck, but noticeably constricts around the bearer’s throat 
while within the presence of seductive undead. When worn, the bearer has
 advantage on any and all rolls made to identifying or recognize 
vampires or vampiric creatures that they can see. If the choker is worn 
by a female creature, the garnet glows with a fiery red light as bright 
as a candle whenever the bearer is within five feet of a vampire. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard stories of eastern mountain towns who
 had dozens of such objects commissioned, as the vampiric count of a 
nearby castle seduced and drained generations of their most beautiful 
young women. The poor girls didn’t realize that the pale but handsome 
nobleman who came courting was interested more in the blood in her veins

 command word while touching a dead body which opens one of the corpse’s
 eyes to reveal a glistening pure white marble. If the body lacked an 
eyeball before, it is now created (As long as the corpse has an eye 
socket) and if there was one, it’s transmuted into marble. When the 
bearer who created the marble opens his eye under the eyepatch, he is 
able to see from the marble’s current point of view. Speaking the 
command word again causes the marble to crumble to dust, no matter how 
far away the bearer is. The eyepatch can only create and be linked to 
one marble at once, creating a new marble causes the old one to crumble 
into dust. Marbles will crumble to dust if removed from the corpse, or 
if they suffer a single point of damage. Perceptive creatures who 
examine the corpse can determine that the marble is not in fact an 
eyeball.</p>

 entire boot giving them a better grip around the foot. The boots 
channel the momentum and energy of the bearer’s kicks into single 
focused points. While worn, the bearer becomes proficient with kick 
attacks and they may kick instead of making a regular weapon attack 
which deals half as much damage as a club. The boots are also treated as

amulet can whisper into it while looking at a creature within 60 feet, 
who hears a comprehensible but distorted version of the words. The 
target hears the words as if they were whispered into his ear even over 
loud ambient sounds such as large crowds but has no way of knowing where
 the whispers are coming from and suffers disadvantage on checks made to
 recognize the voice due to the magical distortion. If the bearer 
attempts to make a true statement or has good intentions in mind for the
 target, the symbol doesn’t function and the bearer takes one psychic 
damage from the magic backlash. Knowledgeable PC’s have heard of these 
items being used by cultists and sadists who have followed their victims
 around for hours a day for weeks or months on end. The bearers fill the
 victims ears with evil intentions, threats of violence, insane 
ramblings and paranoia. Those plagued by the distorted auditory 
hallucinations eventually go mad under the pressure and lash out 
typically killing a few of their friends or family before taking their 
own life.</p>

 The Dead. The book is imbued with the smallest fraction of the Raven 
Queen’s power and the bearer can use to to communicate with the recently
 dead. To use the tome, the bearer must place a corpse’s hand or similar
 appendage on the tome and ask one question aloud. After one minute, the
 answer appears written in blood in the book. The answer is provided by 
the dead creature’s spirit to the best of its knowledge and is 
translated into a language of the bearer’s choice. This ability must be 
used within five minutes of the creature’s death, and a given creature 
can only be asked one question in this manner. The dead creature must 
have had a soul and spoken at least one language for the tome to 
function. The tome can be used once per day in this manner and each use

 Knowledgeable PC’s can combine the three objects into a single helmet 
with a face harness that suspends the mirror in front of the bearer’s 
eyes. After a minute or two of adjustment and refocus (Experienced 
creatures do not require this time) the bearer can move around and 
interact with objects, other creatures and even attack normally while 
viewing themselves from a third person perspective. The bearer can see 
in ten foot radius around themselves which can be adjusted to 20 feet in
 a semicircle if the user cranes his neck in the right direction. This 
allows the bearer to see creatures behind him and easily see around 
corners and overtop of low barricades. Past the limits of the new sight 
however the bearer is effectively blind. The bearer can still examine 
objects up close by holding them in hand and glancing down under the 
mirror. The mirror can be replaced or removed from the harness (This 
requires two free hands and one full round) should the bearer wish to 
switch perspectives.</p>

 take on a measure of substance and can no longer pass through objects

still lack weight and retain the ability to fly. They can pick up and

glass links that look too fragile to ever be used for any purpose other 
than decoration. When worn as a necklace or belt, the chain subtly 
increases coordination, poise and grace in the bearer’s every action. 
Simple repetitive tasks, such as cutting food, pushing back stray hair 
or scratching an itch become agile maneuvers and the bearer’s normal 
walking gait becomes smooth catlike strides. The bearer seems to glide 
and sweep airily through any situation with even savage weapons strikes 
becoming as elegant as a ballerina’s steps. Knowledgeable PC’s will 
recognize these items as popular among nobles and courtiers who wish to 
impress to impress other with their physical poise without ever needing 
to practice or have any natural talent. They are especially prized among
 ambassadors to elven courts as a way of better fitting in among the 
naturally graceful beings. Actions that were smooth to begin with such 
as expert juggling, sleight of hand, card tricks or pickpocketing seem 
to be made with unearthly grace. It doesn’t make any such movements less
 noticeable, in fact some actions such as pickpocketing or attempting to
 pass through a crowd undetected may draw even more attention as the 
bearer’s supernaturally precise movements tend to draw wayward eyes. The
 bearer is granted advantage on checks made to garner attention to 
himself, sleight of hand tricks made for performances, dancing for an 
audience, appearing conspicuous and other such situations. Any 
creature’s viewing the bearer’s flowing movements have advantage on any 
perception based checks made against him in situations regarding his 
attempts to blend in to a crowd, hide from sight, appear inconspicuous 
or unimportant and any sleight of hand or pickpocketing checks made to 
steal. The chain must be worn for 24 hours before its magic attunes to 
the bearer and seeps into his body. The chain struggles with any display
 of gross incompetence and if the bearer is tripped, subjected to 
unwanted forced movement or critically fails a task that the chain 
effects, there is a 5% chance it will shatter.</p>

When placed on a table it will summon a meal and cutlery from another 
table currently set up so somewhere in the world. It may be a peasants 
half eaten soup, a parties catering, or a prisoners’ last meal. After 
one hour or if the candle is removed from the table, any uneaten food 
and objects from the original summoning return to whence they came. It 
is usable up to three times per day and will always steal from a table 
that is smaller than the one the candlestick is placed on. Using this 
item is considered a crime as there is no way of paying back the 
original food owner. Constant use of this object on large banquet or 
feasting tables is sure to attract attention from the wealthy 
individuals enraged over the theft of their food. —Note: This item may 
seem strong but remember that most traveling PC’s will not have a table 
on hand and even then it is highly unlikely that a small folding table 
would be bigger than a meal worth stealing. For simplicity’s sake if 
your PC’s use this a lot, I recommend having a separate table on hand of
 possible meals that appear or rolling a 1d4 and describing the meal as;
 1, poor quality, barely edible or outright spoiled food. 2, Typical 
healthy and filling but bland peasant food. 3, A reasonably well 
seasoned meal made from quality ingredients made by someone who knew 
what they were doing. 4, A masterfully presented dining experience of 
rare ingredients that create a symphony of flavors on the tongue.</p>

guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts 
as a sentinel against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving 
such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed 
inside a sarcophagus, coffin or grave of some sort alongside a dead body
 and activated, a mummified guardian infuses the corpse with positive 
energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature. 
Furthermore, if the corpse is touched, moved or otherwise disturbed by a
 living creature, the guardian animates and attacks the defilers. The 
guardian is five times as strong as a normal cat and is highly resistant
 to most damage and can only be properly destroyed by holy energy, fire.
 If the guardian survives the fight, it returns to rest next to the 
corpse it was protecting. The guardian is activated by placing a small 
piece of the corpse that it’s meant to guard in its mouth and leaving it
 touching the body. —Note:If your game doesn’t have pregenerated

bearer can pray to their God while considering an action, item or 
situation that could adversely affect his alignment and his standing 
with the deity, including magical effects, unknown circumstances or long
 term consequences. Should the bearer reflect for a minute on his faith 
and beliefs, his deity sends a small sign (Which varies and takes a form
 appropriate to the personality of the God) of what to do or not to do, 
should there be serious moral implications to the act. The bearer may 
receive no sign should the object be used compulsively or if the God 
doesn’t care either way about the outcome of the situation. The item and
 associated vision in no way force the bearer to follow the action, it 
simply provides them direction and the opportunity to exercise their 
free will. —Note: An example of this would be for a righteous and moral 
paladin using the phylactery to seek guidance on whether or not to kill a
 captured prisoner who is a murderous bandit. After praying, the paladin
 may open his eyes to see a dove or a raven suddenly burst into flight 
from a nearby tree, a message to either spare or take the criminal’s 
life. This object is designed for characters who need to follow a strict
 moral code or must retain their alignment for one reason or another.</p>

 this being coveted among thieves guilds and wilderness rangers for 
various reasons. It allows rogues to hide in plain sight as blind 
beggars with heavy bandages around their eyes and if taken hostage, they
 are unaffected by the black-bag-over-head-treatment. In a similar vein,
 rangers are able to hide in the wild simply by fully covering 
themselves in an appropriately colored cloak while still being able to 
see out perfectly. Few people choose to wear it for long amounts of

functions as a seldom used, ranged weapon or distraction for the 
desperate and unarmed or as an “Ace in the hole” for tricksters and 
roguish types who may call upon it regularly in conjunction with a well 
aimed punch, as a way of instigating a brawl or to cut down a wounded 
foe who is getting away. The bearer can place a single nonmagical sling 
bullet on top of the empty setting, which causes the ammunition to 
shrink and merge seamlessly into the ring. While the ring is “loaded” in
 this way, the bearer can fire the bullet with a single thought. After 
being launched from the ring the bullet instantly expands back to normal
 size and the attack and damage is treated as though the bearer had 
launched it with a sling he was proficient with. Once the bullet has 
been fired from the ring, a new bullet can’t be placed inside for 24 
hours. The ring is protected by minor shielding wards and when worn by a
 living creature it does not give off a magical aura and is not 
detectable as a magical object. —Note: The bullet is meant to be fired 
using only a thought thus making it a “free action” in most game terms. 
This allows a creature to fire it at the same moment they land a punch, 
essentially granting a second attack that automatically hits (Since 
logically the bullet cannot miss at point blank, punching range) once 
per day. Otherwise it allows a melee character to still make a single 
ranged attack. The DM can adjust the usefulness of this item by ruling 
that the damage does OR does not include the normal ability score bonus 
(Strength or dexterity) that a sling weapon would deal, or that the 
bearer does OR does not suffer disadvantage on the attack roll if they 
have already attacked, or are wielding an object in their ring hand. </p>

experience it again with a fresh set of eyes. The bearer cannot change 
the past and is simply re-experiencing their own memory without having 
to make any kind of decisions or physical actions leaving them free to 
focus on details. The bearer gains advantage to any checks involving 
perception, or memory that they may have missed the first time around 
but could have potentially seen or heard. For example, a spying bearer 
may activate the hourglass after missing a key word in an eavesdropped 
conversation and seeing if they can make it out better the second time, 
while a card player might activate it discreetly to quickly double check
 if his opponent was actually displaying a tell or if it was just an 
unrelated twitch. The hourglass can be activated three times per day but
 requires ten minutes between each use as the white sands of time 
trickle back down to the bottom to be upturned again. The bearer must 
wear the necklace for 24 consecutive hours before it can be activated.

 hides the ugliness within, as the band is cursed and it embeds itself 
into the bearer’s skin the moment it’s put on. Each time the bearer 
attempts to do something and fails (Such as a skill check, save throw or
 attack), they hear a voice in their head which mocks them for their 
choices and failures. The ring is intelligent enough to routinely invent
 new and creatively insulting comments for its bearer’s misfortunes, but
 doesn’t seem to have its own personality, goals, wants or desires and 
will not carry on a conversation. The ring can be removed by twisting 
and tearing on the deeply embedded metal which rips off the fused skin 
and the deep tissue underneath. This process causes three points of hit 
point damage per character level (Or 30% of their maximum health or 
other equivalent amount) to the bearer. The bearer first hears the 
ring’s voice the moment the ring is donned, as the cursed band brutally 
mocks the bearer for putting it on without checking it for curses.

causing the bearer’s blood to well up to the base of them, always

continually fresh and ripples in beat to the bearer’s pulse. The choker 
acts as a sort of filter for blood causing the bearer to take on some of
 the qualities of a vampire, however this process is taxing on the 
bearer and cripples their ability to heal and be healed. The main 
influence of the choker on the bearer’s system are mild cravings for 
blood and short term euphoric highs when blood is consumed. Long term 
use of the item can leave former bearers addicted to drinking blood even
 long after the choker is removed. While worn, the bearer’s gains only 
half as much hit points (Rounded down) from all sources of mundane and 
magical healing Simply wearing the choker causes the bearer to age at 
half his normal rate, even if no blood is consumed. If the bearer has 
drank at least one cup (236 milliliters) of fresh humanoid blood in the 
past 24 hours he doesn’t need to eat or drink other substances to live 
in addition to the slowed aging. If the bearer has drank two cups (472 
milliliters / 1 pint) of fresh humanoid blood in the past 24 hours he 
doesn’t need to sleep in addition to all the other effects. The choker 
must be worn for at least 24 hours before gaining the benefits of the 
item but during that time and for one hour after the choker is removed, 
the bearer suffers from the reduced healing. —Note: For PC’s who think 
they can abuse the item by feeding on party members or hired NPC’s, two 
cups (Or one pint) of blood is equivalent to a modern day blood 
donation. Adult humans have about 10.5 pint of blood in their body and 
it takes about four to six weeks to replenish a single pint of blood. 
Repeated feedings on fellow party members or hired “cattle” servants 
would result in their death. </p>

symbols and emblems of nearly every conceivable God, superstitious 
belief or minor deity. The chain can either be worn as a necklace of 
varying lengths or wrapped several times around the wrist creating a 
thick charm bracelet. Both styles are usually worn quite prominently in 
order to fully utilize the chain’s magic. While worn, all creatures 
other than the bearer that look at the chain only see the charms or holy
 symbols associated with the gods, or beliefs they personally worship or
 hold in high regard. This object is often used as a way to gain favour 
or seek shelter with religious family homes and temples wherever the 
bearer goes. Wearing the chain occasionally backfires if other creatures
 compare notes about what symbols they see on the chain, however a quick
 witted bearer can easily steer the conversation away from religion 
while still mentioning that he wears his faith in plain view for allies 
of his beliefs to openly take notice of. The chain is best used by 
having it covered most of the time, only using it as an “ace in the 
hole” while attempt to positively influence (Persuasion, bluff and 
diplomacy type rolls) other creatures. Knowledgeable PC’s will have 
heard a tale of a politician who wore a chain similar to this one while 
campaigning for election in a large city known for its many opposing 
religions. There was a strong cultural tradition at the time of never 
speaking of politics and religion at the same time out of respect for 
both and because of this each religion thought that the politician was 
one of them and thus had his support. He was nearly unanimously elected 
until he managed to get caught in his lies and was violently executed by
 his former supporters for his blasphemous ways. Because of the 
reluctance to attract any attention to the item from actual deities who 
would no doubt take offense to its function, the chain is almost never 
used as a holy focus (Although functions perfectly as one) for spells or
 channeling divinity. If actively used as a divine focus, there is a 5% 
chance that the chain attracts the attention of a displeased God and 
violently shatters, dealing 1d4 points of damage to the bearer.</p>

 react the same as a wild animal might in whatever situation they are

otherwise will seek out large sources of sugar and a nearby colony of 
their regular sized sistren. New ants can be added to the bottle at any 
time but the bottle must remain sealed for one month before a maximum of
 ten of the ants inside it become enchanted to grow in size. The

against hostile magics. A mage must fill this bottle with three things: 
something of themselves (blood, hair, tears, etc); something volatile 
(lamp oil, explosive chemicals, grain alcohol, etc); and something sharp
 (nails, pins, razors, etc). Afterwards the mage must attune to the 
bottle by placing a small portion of their life essence within the 
bottle. This ritual takes one hour and reduces the mage’s maximum hit 
points by 1 point until the bottle is used, destroyed or is more than 
one mile away from the attuned creature. Once attuned, the next time the
 mage would fail a saving throw against magic, the Witch Bottle instead 
fails for them, trapping the spell within it and violently explodes in a
 shower of glass and sharp objects, dealing damage equivalent to a 
dagger to everything in a five foot radius of itself. The bottle must be
 within 30 feet of the attuned creature in order for this to function. 
The mage cannot suppress or delay this effect and should he fail a 
saving throw for a magical effect, the bottle must explode. Typically 
the bottle is buried underground or placed in a strategic location 
(Where enemies are likely to stand) so the mage is not harmed by the 
blast. Knowledgeable PC’s know that commoners sometimes see witches 
completely shrug off spells cast against them and believe the witches to
 be extremely resilient, when in fact they are utilizing a bottle such

critical successes or natural 20’s of any form are possible within this

success, he is instead treated as if he’d rolled a critical failure. 
Fiasco can only be uncorked when held by a living humanoid (Taking an

bearer’s death, even if his body is utterly destroyed. The ring then 
then becomes a possessed object, however the possessing soul cannot 
animate the ring and must instead wait for someone to don it. The soul 
can then telepathically communicate with the new bearer, although it 
does not have any true influence over the bearer’s mind and cannot 
possess or take control of the bearer. The soul remains in the diamond 
for a year and a day after which the spirit is released to its 
appropriate afterlife. While in the ring, the soul knows when a creature
 has put on the ring and can sense the world as the bearer can (Hearing,
 sight, smell, etc.). The soul cannot otherwise sense the area around it
 or take actions other than communicating with the bearer. If the bearer
 dies while the ring is filled, the year and a day timer is reset for 
the trapped soul and the bearer’s soul is released into the appropriate 
afterlife. As a result, many such rings contains souls of long dead 
creatures who constantly encourage their bearers towards acts of danger 
or certain death. The bearer does not have any control over the soul but
 may attempt to bargain with it for information. —Note: A DM can choose 
to have the ring filled with a soul already with X number of days left 
on it (Or the soul of an enemy they just killed giving them an angry 
guide) or have the ring simply be empty. While bargaining, the trapped 
souls typically only want three things: 1, To be brought back to life 
somehow. 2, To have their unfinished business completed so they feel 
ready to move on to the afterlife. 3, To live forever in the ring by 
having other creatures die while wearing it.</p>

spending one uninterrupted hour of peaceful meditation while pressing 
their lips to the head as if participating in an overly long, macabre 
kiss. The appeased spirit will then offer the creature its protection 
and the next time the bearer fails a saving throw on a mind-affecting

of an open mouthed skull, lined with small tentacles instead of teeth. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize that the amulet is made from a single 
large tooth carved from an aberrant creature from a plane of chaos and 
disorder. If the amulet is worn consistently over the course of a week, 
the bearer’s teeth become three inch long, enamel capped, tentacles that
 look more like smaller, white tipped tongues than anything else. This 
process occurs slowly over the course of the week as the bearers gums 
gain muscle and push the teeth upwards into small stubs. Over time, the 
teeth themselves flatten to fit over the appendages, with incisors and 
canines retaining their sharpness and molars retaining their ridging. 
The tentacles are able to crush food in a similar manner to normal teeth
 although the new chewing process is horrifying for spectators, should 
the bearer chew with their mouth open. When the process is fully 
complete the creature gains and becomes proficient with a bite attack, 
as their newly lengthened and prehensile teeth are able to find and rend
 flesh with a much greater degree of ease. The bite attack deals as much
 damage as a dagger and should the creature already have a bite attack, 
they may treat their new maw as a +1 weapon. The initial transformation 
process is mildly uncomfortable and the bearer’s mouth may be more 
sensitive while eating or when drinking hot or cold liquids but it is 
not painful in and of itself. If the bearer does not wear the amulet for
 more than a day, the process begins to reverse itself and a fully 
transformed creature will have normal teeth again a week and a day after
 the amulet is removed. The reversal process is excruciatingly painful 
and often requires medicine or magic to alleviate the creature’s 
suffering. The reversal process including the associated pain, stops the
 moment the amulet is put back on. It goes without saying that these 
tentacles are extremely noticeable and may cause the bearer to speak 
differently and that most creatures the bearer will come into contact 
with will no doubt react with shock and horror rather than curiosity and
 open arms.</p>
