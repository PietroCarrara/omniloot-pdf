            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

containing a pair of blank pieces of paper that cannot be removed. When 
examined, the small paper cards appear to be whatever the reader expects
 to see. If handed to a literate guard with the explanation that the 
paper is in fact a writ of passage, a license, or some other document, 
the guard would see it as such. The bearer gains advantage on all 
charisma based checks (Bluff, deception, diplomacy, etc.) to convince 
the reader that they are who they say they are and that the credentials 
are genuine. This object only functions on creatures with no innate 
psychic abilities and who have a lower intelligence score than the 
bearer, otherwise the reader only sees blank paper, wavy lines or 
gibberish text. The paper ceases to display anything if it is more than 
ten feet away from the bearer but this does not break attunement. The 
paper must stay in the bearer’s possession for a full three days in 
order to attune to his mind and can only be attuned to one creature at a
 time.</p>

binding contract) on parchment or leather. When the document is signed 
by each creature mentioned by name in it, the script as well as the 
material it’s written on spontaneously combusts. The resulting black 
flames completely engulfs the material and after a moment nothing is 
left but a layer of fine white ash. After the document burns itself out,
 each creature whose name was on it is able to flawlessly recall the 
entire text for a period of a year and a day, after which they start to 
forget as normal. The vial contains enough ink for 3d6 contracts.</p>

 50 feet and understand the words that are being spoken. The bearer must
 have a clear line of sight to the creature and adequate lighting

 glowing oil. The oil can be carefully applied to one weapon (Or up to 
15 pieces of ammunition) over the course of an hour in order to grant it
 a weak magical enchantment. <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/10229/">Roll on the Minor Weapon Enchantments Table</a>
 and the weapon gains that property or reroll if the specific 
enchantment is not appropriate for the weapon. The weapon may undergo 
physical changes (As per the enchantment’s description) following the 
application, causing it to shift in form or take on additional 
properties. The physical changes and enchantment are permanent. The oil 
doesn’t mix well with existing magic and has no effect if applied to a 
weapon that is already enchanted. —Note: It is up to the DM whether the 
oil’s enchantment is random or not. The oil’s magical enchantment could 
have been pre-rolled by the DM and could be determined by a successful 
magical identification check by a PC or the oil could be a type of wild 
or unknown magic that is too random to identify. A default option is 
that the enchanted weapon can be activated once per day causing it to 
become a +1 weapon for one minute.</p>

 metal disks one foot in diameter. When placed on a flat surface or less
 than one foot underground (Or under leaves, a carpet or other light 
covering) and the command word is spoken it functions as a sort of 
sentry. A creature weighing 50 pounds or more that steps on the disc or 
the ground above it, will trigger a pillar of light five feet wide and 
ten feet tall centered on the disk’s location. The light is as bright as
 a campfire, coloured the same as the disk and fades after two rounds. 
The disk cannot be activated again for eight hours. Each disk functions 
completely independently with its own command word and timer.</p>

raised, can projects shadows upon the bearer’s face. This magical shade 
is impenetrable by normal means, and is not dispelled even by direct 
bright light. With a thought the bearer can choose how much of their 
face is covered by the shadows or how opaque they are, ranging from 
light shadows that serve to obscure, partial darkness that only reveals 
the eyes or a pitch black void that covers the entire face. The shadows 
remain this way until the bearer chooses to change them or dismisses 
them entirely. The hood automatically provides a pitch black full face 
covering whenever the bearer is surprised (Such as when he takes damage 
or rolls initiative) or becomes unconscious, making it an invaluable 
tool for thieves, rogues and assassins. The bearer’s sight is never 
diminished when the shadows are active and a bearer who does not wish 
the hood to accidentally activate can simply lower it, rather than 
remove it entirely. Creature with darkvision can’t see through the 
magical darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.</p>

nutritious meal that only a beast would find palatable. Once per day, 
upon command the bowl fills with a nutritious meal of liver and fish 
flavored mush. Most carnivorous and omnivorous animals enjoy the flavor 
and it provides enough nourishment to sustain such a creature for an 
entire day. Intelligent creatures and herbivores find the mush to be 
inedible. The created food disappears after one hour if not eaten.</p>

humanoid skull dangling from a short length of heavy iron chain. A small
 fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless 
flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull’s eye sockets, casting
 virulent green light with the intensity of a candle in the direction

carved with indecipherable letters attached to an almost completely 
rotten away scrap of leather. If a humanoid creature buries the tag in 
loose earth unearth a large chunk of raw meat or steak and remains 
within ten feet of the tag for eight hours, a large mastiff formed of 
earth arises from ground. The dog is wearing the tag and is 
affectionate, loyal and obeys the telepathic commands (100 foot range) 
of the humanoid, who it considers its new owner. The creature has the 
same statistics of a mastiff (Or wolf if your DM is generous) but it is 
considered a construct rather than a living being. If killed or 
destroyed, the dog can be recreated after a period of one week, using 
the same tag burying process.</p>

                <td><p>Witch Bottle of Trapping: A clear glass wine 
bottle covered with various arcane runes, this object can act as a form 
of protection for witches (Or any creature capable of casting spells) 
against hostile magics. A mage must fill this bottle with three things: 
something of themselves (blood, hair, tears, etc); something that binds 
(rope, glue, wine, etc); and something sharp (nails, pins, razors, etc).
 Afterwards the mage must attune to the bottle by placing a small 
portion of their life essence within the bottle. This ritual takes one 
hour and reduces the mage’s maximum hit points by 1 point until the 
bottle is used, destroyed or is more than one mile away from the attuned
 creature. Once attuned, the next time the mage would fail a saving 
throw against magic, the Witch Bottle instead fails for them, trapping 
the spell within it. The bottle must be within 30 feet of the attuned 
creature in order for this to function. The mage cannot suppress or 
delay this effect and should he fail a saving throw for a magical 
effect, the bottle must absorb the magic. Once used, the bottle’s 
contents have a 1-in-4 chance of becoming a potion relevant to the spell
 it captured (See Note). Once the bottle captures a spell, the arcane 
runes fade it never functions as a protective ward again. Knowledgeable 
PC’s know that rumors of witches completely shrug off spells cast 
against them are not always due to their natural resilience, as they may
 be utilizing a bottle such as this. —Note: A captured spell of a fire 
type might become a potion of resist fire for example. The potion should
 always be the weakest type of its kind available in your setting and a 
DM can always default to a healing potion if a there are no relevant 
types of potions to choose from.</p>

out of a wolf pelt, with the head of the animal incorporated as the 
hood. While wearing the cloak the bearer emits the pheromones and scents
 of the strongest natural predator in the local area. A useful item in 
wilderness survival as the cloak will deter other predators, scavengers 
and some vermin from approaching the bearer. Its use makes hunting and 
stalking difficult as the scent cannot be easily masked. Mundane animals
 including domesticated dogs and horses consider the bearer a threat and
 will not come within 30 feet unless first threatened and unable to 
flee. The cloak must be worn for one hour before the magic takes effect 
and the scents linger for 30 minutes after it is removed.</p>

agnostic or intelligent creature who has no religious affiliation that 
could possibly be inducted into the bearer’s religion. For example: If 
the bearer’s religion only accepted humans, the headband would point the
 bearer to the nearest religiously unaffiliated, agnostic or atheistic 
human. Knowledgeable PC’s will know that items like these are sometimes 
given to members of churches that venture out on missionary journeys to 
serve as a constant guide to the nearest soul that needs to be saved.</p>

circular lines of smoke in a 15 foot radius around the candle. The 
circle is then protected against intrusion by astrally projected 
creatures, ethereal creatures, ghosts, shadows, haunts, incorporeal

cannot enter the area of effect, cast spells into the area or magically 
influence creatures within the area. Capable and intelligent spirits

 face of lesser mortals. The reverse side is padded delicately with a

personality and loves burning things but doesn’t like hurting living 
creatures (Even indirectly) and refuses to ever do so. A bearer who asks
 Fuegis (Who speak ignan and common) politely can convince him to change
 the colour, brightness, and size of the flame, from the equivalent of a
 candle to that of a torch. At the bearer’s request, Fuegis can launch a
 ball of fire with perfect accuracy against target which deals fire 
damage equivalent to a shortsword. Fuegis will never launch fire at a 
living creature or at an area that will ignite causing immediate harm to
 living creatures. Should the flame on the end of the rod ever go out 
(Such as being doused or snuffed, the flame is no more resilient than a 
non-magical fire of the same size), the elemental will be banished back 
to the plane of fire and the rod will lose all magical properties. 
Fuegis requires oxygen in order to remain burning but the rod provides

means. It cannot be sensed in any way other than with one’s own eyes, 
ears, touch, smell, or taste. If the object is viewed through another 
creature’s point of view (Such as possessing a creature or experiencing 
its memories.) it will be invisible, noiseless, intangible and lacking 
of taste and scent. A creature who has experienced it through their own 
senses becomes completely unable to imagine what it looks and feels like
 once they stop actively experiencing it, though it is recognizable when
 seen again. The creature can remember that they interacted with 
“something” and vague things about the interaction (They were able to 
hold it in one hand, it did not cause pain to touch, etc.) but the 
object seems to be the literal representation of “Out of sight, out of 
mind” and is widely considered the world’s worst object to lose. Those 
who have had interactions with the orb and have tried to recall anything
 about it describe the attempt as having the memory “Right at the tip of
 the tongue.” and that their mind just draws a blank every time they 
try. Creature’s viewing the object find that they are physically 
incapable of drawing a picture of it, writing down a description on 
paper, creating a sculpture or magical illusion of it or other such 
means of creating a permanent description or representation of it. The 
orb has a thin seam that runs around it and the sphere can be opened to 
reveal a fist sized interior. Any objects stored within the orb gains 
some of the forgetting properties of the orb itself. Objects stored 
within the orb cannot be affected by most magical means and creatures 
who are not actively looking at the orb cannot imagine or remember what 
it looks like. When an object is removed from the orb the forgetting 
magic instantly fades and all creatures are able to imagine and remember
 it as normal.</p>

surface that will hover above the ground at the height desired by the 
user. The desk can be repositioned by hand by the user as desired. It 
will support up to 50 pounds of weight so the user can lean on the desk 
to write. Each cap also serves a function. The unseen portion of the 
first cap is a detailed clay model of a pond, complete with rocks, 
plants and grasses, the ‘water’ of which is ink. The water level remains
 constant until the ink reservoir runs dry, and may be refilled. The ink
 in the pond cap will not spill, even if tipped on its side or used to 
cap the rolled-up desk. The other cap is formed into an octopus on a 
rocky seabed, the arms of which grasp four quills or brushes, and they 
will be held in place when the cap is employed. When finished, the user 
need only grasp the desk at one end and re-roll it. A maximum of 4 
brushes, one pot of ink, and 12 sheets of paper/parchment/vellum may be 
stored in the desk when rolled for travel.</p>

tool of murder and violent subterfuge by assassins, spies and 
clandestine operatives. Once per round, the bearer can reach one or two 
free hands within the cloak and withdraw one or two daggers made of 
gloomy magical force, using an action equivalent to drawing a weapon.

cruel weapons made for nothing other than inflicting vicious wound and 
whenever the player roll a 1 on a die to calculate the weapon’s damage, 
they can reroll the die until they receive a result that is not a 1. The
 umbral knives are held together by tentative magic and dissipate into

The cloak displays no mundane emblems, crests or insignia that might aid
 an observer to recall details about it or the bearer, nor does it bear

 would provide a clue as to its true nature. The cloak is protected by

day for each finger, toe or tooth that needs to be regrown and during

times it doesn’t function, a lame limb that is fully there but may have 
healed wrong after a break or a bad back can also be regenerated at the

women. The other side is dull lead and has the image of a filthy beggar

corner occupied only by rats and corpse of a dog that appears to have 
starved to death. A creature holding the coin feels the potential for 
great success or great failure locked inside, waiting to be released.

about to perform (Such as a skill check, saving throw or attack) that

the creature is treated as if they rolled a natural 20 or critical

to death and that every corpse is a portal to somewhere they want to be.
 The bearer of the sandals can step into a humanoid corpse and instantly
 step out of another corpse they are aware of within 100 feet. This does
 not take an action as is treated as movement, like stepping through a 
door. Although the process appears instantaneous to others, the bearer 
experiences several seconds of whatever afterlife they believe damned 
souls reside after death. These souls take notice of the bearer and 
cling to his body and spirit, dealing one hit point of unavoidable 
damage per character level (Or 10% of maximum health or other equivalent
 amount) as his soul is clawed and torn by the spirits.  The lost souls 
become more familiar with the bearer if he uses the sandals repeatedly 
and with each subsequent use the damage increases by one hit per 
character level (Or 10%). For each 24 hours that progress without the 
sandals being used by that specific creature, the damage lowers by 1 hit
 point (Or 10%) to a minimum of 1 damage (Or 10%). If the bearer dies as
 a result of damage done by the souls, all of his equipment appears in a
 pile at the location of the corpse he meant to step out of but his body
 and soul remain in the underworld. The sandals must be worn for 24 
hours before the bearer begins to feel the siren call of the corpses and

sharp steel scissors, fabric and wood for a single arm or leg split, two
 vials of antitoxin, an oral thermometer, two flasks of rubbing alcohol,
 and a handbook containing detailed instructions for basic emergency 
care, how to stabilize casualties and general first aid written in 
whatever language the current reader understands best. A bearer who 
reads the books for ten minutes per day is considered proficient in the 
use of the healer’s hit. Any object taken out of the bag will crumble 
into dust after 24 hours unless it is still being used or attached to 
(Typically bandages, splints, thread and tea still being drunk) a 
wounded creature. The bag fully restocks itself each day at dawn. If the
 owner of the bag ever purposely charges a patient or wounded creature 
in return for treatment from the bag’s contents, the bag never restocks 
itself while within a mile of that creature for a year and a day. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard rumors of an object like this passed 
down from field medic, to front line war surgeon, to wandering 
missionary, to overworked refugee center nurse, to benevolent plague 
doctor, etc always being owned and used by a person of great integrity 
and altruistic self-sacrifice who saved countless lives. According to 
its legend, this object has existed for longer than some empires and 
always seems to finds its way to places where it’s needed most. A 
perceptive PC will find a minute holy symbol of the God of healing on 
the bottom of the bag’s interior.   —Note: The distinction between 
accept and charge is important. The bearer can accept donations of 
goods, service or money that patients give him, but he cannot demand any
 form of payment before treatment or present any form of bill afterwards
 or even imply that something is owed in any way without losing access 
to the bag’s magic.</p>
