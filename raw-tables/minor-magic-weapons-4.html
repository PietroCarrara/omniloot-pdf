    <div class="description">
        <h4 class="heading">Description (more info)</h4>
        <div> 
            <p>The first magic weapon a character receives in a video 
game, roleplaying game or a novel is rarely the strongest weapon they 
will come across. As the story progresses they may leave their original 
weapon behind as they move on to stronger enchantments and true 
artifacts of world ending power. Or they may find that their weapon’s 
strength is directly proportional to their own and that as they become 
the hero they were meant to be, their weapon becomes a conduit of that 
potential. Video games in particular have little issue handing out 
breadcrumbs of increasingly powerful magic weapons to allow the player 
to keep up with increasingly difficult enemies and satisfying their 
looting needs. In many RPG settings however there are few mechanical 
ways to make a weapon stronger than normal but weaker than a standard +1
 enchantment. Oftentimes these settings will be plentiful in rich 
descriptions of end game artifact weapons with epic tier abilities, 
while having no lower level unique weapons whatsoever. As the majority 
of campaigns start and take place mostly in the lower levels it means 
that players read about and yearn for these interesting weapons they 
will likely never use. To combat this I’ve drawn on inspiration from 
hundreds of sources to develop a collection of Unique Minor Magic 
Weapons that are scaled down versions of their stronger counterparts. In
 game they can appear as cheap imitations, homages or legacy weapons 
gain in strength with their wielder. These are essentially artifact 
weapons for level 1 characters with all of the charm, mystery and flair 
of their epic level counterparts. They have drawbacks, limitations and 
can relay on the strength of their wielder but can provide the extra 
little bump to turn a TPK into a collective near death experience. These
 unique weapons allow a DM to easily provide a weak but flavorful 
addition to their world.</p>

                <td><p>The Subtle Knife: A dagger made of an 
unidentifiable dark material streaked with swirling lights of green and 
blue and hints of globules of amber. The blade can never dull and 
remains incredibly, unimaginably sharp, nearly capable of slicing 
through the fabric of reality itself, even a petty nick by the blade can
 shear off fingers with ease. The knife’s handle is made of wood and 
adorned with a relief of golden wire in the shape of an angel with 
spread wings on one side and an angel with closed wings on other side. 
The wire is slightly elevated from the wood of the handle to ensure a 
firm grip on the weapon. The knife rests in a special leather sheath 
with straps meant to hold the dagger securely in place while not in use,
 as it can effortlessly cut through even the thickest leather. Whenever 
the player rolls the maximum result on the dagger’s damage die (A 4 on a
 d4), they can roll that die an additional time and add both results to 
the total damage dealt. The player continues to roll and add to the 
total damage dealt until he gets a result that is not the maximum 
result. Wielding the blade is delicate work as it wasn’t made 
specifically for combat and whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an
 attack roll, he must roll 1d4. If the result is also a 1, the wielder 
catches his own body with the knife and the player rolls damage as 
normal for the weapon (Including the potentially compounding damage 
dice) and the result is dealt to the wielder.  —Note: This bonus only 
affect the weapon’s damage itself and not other sources of additional 
damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects.</p>

studded with heavy iron rivets. Carved along the length of the weapon 
rests the ancient pearl of wisdom; “Speak Softly And Carry A Big Stick.”
 The greatclub is treated as a +1 weapon but while it is being wielded 
and for ten minutes afterwards, the bearer cannot speak louder than a 
barely audible whisper. This does not hinder spellcasting (Unless the 
spell requires the target to hear the bearer) as the bearer is still 
able to speak but he cannot provide rallying cries to allies, give 
instructions, shout for help, or yell warnings. The forced whispering 
hinders the bearer’s ability to properly project their personality and 
they suffer disadvantage on all charisma based checks that rely on them 
speaking. —Note: In game terms only creatures within five feet of the 
bearer or victim can hear him whispering in optimal conditions. During 
loud situations such as combat, thunderstorms or in a loud taverns, 
whispers cannot be heard at all.</p>

                <td><p>Kashta: A twin-firing, heavy crossbow that’s 
nothing if not a monstrous feat of engineering, worked in old metal and 
embellished with images of lions and the faces of strange, fierce gods. 
The dual action firing reduces the crossbow’s accuracy by about half but
 since its releasing twice as much ammunition it balances itself out 
most of the time. A proficient wielder can usually manage two glancing 
blows somewhere on the target causing smaller consistent injuries but a 
veteran bowman can account for the kickback and plant both bolts into an
 enemy for a devastating effect. Whenever the wielder successfully hits a
 target, instead of a single damage die the player rolls two dice that 
equal the value of the original damage die (See Note) and add the 
results together. Whenever the wielder attacks with advantage and hits 
the target, if the lower of the two d20 results would have also hit the 
target, the attack is considered a critical hit instead of a regular one
 (See Note 2). The wielder is able to load two bolts into Kashta and 
crank the heavy crossbow as easily as a loading a single bolt into a 
typical crossbow. Kashta can be fired with just a single bolt but gains 
none of the special bonuses previously listed. If the wielder wishes to 
fire special ammunition such as silvered, poisoned or enchanted bolts, 
he must load two of the same type or the ammunition has no special 
effect.  —Note: If a normal heavy crossbow dealt 1d10 damage, Kashta 
deal 1d4+1d6 instead. —Note 2: This works best in the D&amp;D 5e 
Advantage / Disadvantage system. In other systems the enchantment’s 
effect might kick in if the PC would have hit the target with its 
straight d20 roll without bonuses or if the attack roll exceeded the 
target’s AC by 5 or more.</p>

 that is made of pure theoretical mathematics. It’s unclear exactly how 
the sword was created or how it functions, but the entire thing is made 
out of flat planes of washed out blue material. Each line comprising the
 blade has its length written in the air next to it, and each angle has 
its degree written likewise. The calculations have qualified with 
perfect accuracy every swing and stab the blade could make as well as 
the precise transmundane frequency of the humming the sword emits. The 
nature of perfection allows no room for deviation of any variety and 
regardless of the any contributing factors, whether they originate from 
the wielder, ally, enemy or the general environment, when the wielder 
makes an attack roll with Practical Math he can never roll with 
advantage or disadvantage, it is always a straight roll. The sword is 
treated as a +1 but whenever the weapon would score a critical hit 
against an enemy, the critical hit is negated and the attack is 
considered a successful but non-critical attack instead for all 
purposes.</p>

petrified bone of a creature whose numbers once walked the land with 
abundance. The species went extinct long before the idea of the written 
word was dreamed of and no living creature has any idea of what the 
animal was named, how it acted or even what it looked like and 
divination and necromantic magics have only provided fleeting glimpses 
as to its nature. Touching the weapon instills a terrible feeling of 
loss, loneliness and isolation regardless of the number of people around
 the bearer. The wielder becomes a solitary figure in their own mind, as
 though they were always on the edge of conversations and companionship 
but never included. These feelings dissipate when the weapon is released
 or whenever a member of the bearer’s own species is nearby. The 
emotional turmoil of the oppressive solitude provides the wielder an 
inner drive to stay alive and fight back against all odds. The weapon is
 treated as a +1 if there are no other living creatures of the wielders 
same species within 100 feet. If the wielder is the last living member 
of his species on the current plane (Which must be the plane of his 
birth), he gains advantage on all attacks made with the longspear and 
every successful attack is considered a critical hit.</p>

                <td><p>Asp Bow: An ornate shortbow intricately carved 
with serpent imagery but otherwise seems utterly mundane. The weapon 
reveals its true character when a wielder notches an arrow, at which 
point the arrowhead assumes the character and likeness of a hissing, 
venomous snake. After being fired, the arrow retains this illusion until
 the start of the wielder’s next turn. Whenever the wielder successfully
 attacks a target, he inflicts poison damage equivalent to a dagger 
(1d4) in addition to the attack’s damage. This additional damage is not 
multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

                <td><p>Death’s Harp: A delicate longbow of spiky black 
bone, strung with seven different catgut cords, resembling as much a 
musical instrument as a weapon. Whenever the weapon is grasped, a few 
lines of poetry flows into the bearer’s mind as if long forgotten but 
suddenly remembered. “The mournful music of the strings, The creaking 
arch, the arrow sings. A choking cry, a rattled breath, The Reaper’s 
Song, the Harp of Death.” The brittle archer’s bow plays a song of 
death, but the harp sings a sweet masterpiece. When the strings are 
touched by skilled fingers they resonate as if yearning to be played. A 
bearer proficient with longbows is considered proficient with the 
instrument as a harp. The bearer feels the morbid urge to witness the 
deaths of as many creatures as he can manage, especially those of his 
own race. This urge is more macabre curiosity rather than homicidal in 
nature and does not encourage the wielder to kill but may urge the 
bearer to do nothing but watch rather than staunch the wound of a 
creature bleeding out. If the bearer personally witnesses the death of a
 creature of their own species, the longbow is treated as a +1 for the 
next eight hours for that wielder only. The eight hour timer is reset 
each time the wielder observer’s such a death.  </p>

                <td><p>Limbsplit: An enormous axe resembling an overly 
woodsplitting tool more than a weapon of war. Its pale green double 
handed grip ends in a weighty granite pommel that serves to balance the 
huge single edged, bearded blade that is firmly bolted on to the shaft. 
Whenever the greataxe is grasped, a few lines of poetry flows into the 
bearer’s mind as if long forgotten but suddenly remembered. “Swinging 
through the air, it sings of sundered, severed, missing things.“ The 
weapon’s honed blade can cause brutal maiming injuries and the sheet 
weight and power behind the wielder’s swing can sever limbs as easily as
 splitting a log if the wielder is able to land a decisive blow. 
Whenever the wielder attacks with advantage and hits the target, if the 
lower of the two d20 results would have also hit the target, the attack 
is considered a critical hit instead of a regular one. —Note: This works
 best in the D&amp;D 5e Advantage / Disadvantage concept. In other 
systems the extra damage might kick in if the PC would have hit the 
target with its straight d20 roll without bonuses or if the attack roll 
exceeded the target’s AC by 5 or more.</p>

handle, made from tiny metal tubes, all twisted about each other. At one
 end there is a scored grip, at the other there is a flat piece of 
metal, pierced with small holes, a long, thin hook curving out from it. 
On the grip is the mark of the master maker Kanedias, silver on the dark
 metal. The Divider has two edges, one here and one on the Other Side 
and its blade cuts through flesh and spirit alike. The battleaxe deals 
damage normally against incorporeal creatures such as ghosts, as if they
 were fully physical beings. Whenever the wielder successfully strikes a
 target, he inflicts force damage equivalent to a dagger (1d4) in 
addition to the attack’s damage. This additional damage is not 
multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

 of the blade has been severed in a jagged break and solid permafrost 
grows from the split in the shape of what was lost. The bleak harshness 
of winter leaves rime rimmed wounds that leak slushy, half frozen blood 
from blackened, frostbitten flesh as the wielder steals their heat. To 
make the most of the weapon the wielder must attune to it by pricking 
their finger with the icy tip of the blade and consuming the resulting 
drop of frozen blood. The natural cryomancy pulses through the wielder’s
 body, causing literal ice to flow in his veins, making him cold-hearted
 indeed. During this time the wielder’s skin becomes pale, his lips blue
 and his body becomes coated in a fine layer of frost. When an attuned 
wielder attacks and damages a living creature, the wielder is healed two
 hit points per character level to a maximum of the total damage dealt 
by the attack (See Note), as the attack leeches the heat straight from 
the victim’s blood and uses the thermal power to reinforce the wielder’s
 icy form. When this occurs, a blurry heat mirage appears around the 
wound and quickly travels up the weapon and into the wielder leaving a 
hazy, shimmering trail that fades after a moment. The attuned creature’s
 physiology and metabolism is slowed by the cold, stunting typical 
healing. The entire time a bearer is attuned, whenever he would regain 
hit points from any source other than the Astra of Winter, he is only 
healed for half (Rounded down, minimum zero) of the actual amount. 
Attunement to the weapon can be renewed at any time (And can be attuned 
to multiple creatures at once) and wears off naturally after 24 hours 
when the cryomancy fades and the bearer warms up to normal temperature 
without issue. The attunement can also be broken with any spell or 
ability that is able to break or dispel curses. —Note: A combat example;
 An attuned 10th level wielder attacks a peasant (Who has 5 remaining 
hit points) and deals 12 damage. The wielder is healed 5 hit points but 
could have regained as much as 24 hit points if the peasant had 24 or 
more hit points remaining.</p>

 steel. Blade, quillions and hilt are all of one piece, the blade is 
honed razor sharp, and the grip is sheathed in bone mounted in silver. 
The pommel-nut is a hemisphere of brightly polished black iron. The 
dagger bears a tassel of grey silk cord and an intricate glyph is etched
 onto the blade itself. Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard of the famous
 sword-forger Hanna Smith who was always a pragmatist at heart. Capable 
of imbuing any number of enchantments into the weapons she created, she 
always believed the greatest way to improve a weapon was to enhance the 
person who wielded it. To this end, she crafted an ultimate weapon for 
herself, a sword that augmented her own body to its ultimate potential. 
The sword served her well and was passed on to her son, who attempted to
 slay a dragon in single combat. Since then, the Blade of Hanna has been
 lost to legend. Twice per day an attuned wielder can (As an action 
equivalent to drawing a weapon) grant himself advantage on ability and 
skill checks of a single ability score (Such as Strength, Dexterity, 
Intelligence or Charisma) for five minutes. Only one creature can be 
attuned to the shortsword at a time and the bearer must spend an hour in
 quiet contemplation with the sword to attune to it.</p>

The weapon is somewhat sentient and imbued with necrotic energy that 
consumes innocent souls and feasts on their sorrows. The blade has been 
instilled with a small amount of intelligence, perception and memory, 
and a malicious personality that desires death and carnage. The wielder 
faintly perceives the greatsword’s simple hungry mind at the edge of 
their consciousness as if through the means of a psionic ability and is 
able to communicate telepathically with it. Bloodsong is able to 
perceive its environment in the same way a human can (Sight, smell, 
sound etc.) to a maximum of a five foot radius around itself. The weapon
 is generally helpful to a wielder who has used it to kill a creature in
 the past 24 hours and will truthfully answer simple fact based, or 
yes/no questions about its origin, history, past wielders, targets it 
struck, etc. It is not able to answer complex questions or those that 
depend on feelings, extensive logical deductions or situations it has 
never witnessed. Bloodsong yearns for battle and when it first deals 
damage and is takes blood in combat, it bellows out a <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9706/">Random Battle Cry</a>
 or a war chant of a cultural, spiritual or personal significance to its
 wielder. Whenever the wielder kills a living creature with Bloodsong, 
he becomes proficient with the drums as a musical instrument and the

creates an invigorating song of violence and blood and upon reaching a

is etched the figure of an unclad female drow with long hair, dancing 
naked before a full moon with a silver bastard sword. Those who gaze 
upon the image are filled with the belief that this woman is the answer 
to the question which every soul feels, but no words can frame. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will be able to identify the design as the holy 
symbol of Eilistraee the Dark Maiden, a Goddess of light, nature and 
life, among other domains and numerous titles. The weapon functions as a
 direct spiritual connection to The Masked Lady and a noble creature can
 make offerings directly to Eilistraee in return a boon from her domain 
of swordwork. A good or neutral aligned creature may lay ten gold coins 
(See Note) along the surface of the weapon and pray to the The Lady of 
the Dance for ten minutes. At the end of this ritual, the gold coins 
vanish and Crescent Blade spouts crimson fire and the weapon is treated 
as a +1 for the next eight hours and on a successful attack, the wielder
 can choose to have all of the damage dealt be considered fire damage 
rather than slashing. These blessings are only active when the longsword
 is wielded by the creature who prayed. The bearer feels a strong sense 
of religious devotion during the eight hour span and feels motivated to 
carry out the basic tenets of Eilistraee’s faith. The wielder is not 
compelled to act in this way and is not forced to violate any strongly 
held morals or beliefs. —Note: Rather than a flat ten gold, the DM can 
rule of another flat value, X gold per character level or other 
reasonable amount.</p>

discharged into a fresh corpse. Once per day as an action equivalent to 
attacking, the wielder can thrust the blade into the remains of a 
humanoid creature that has been dead for no longer than eight hours. 
This causes the corpse to rise from the dead as a zombie under the 
control of the wielder. The undead loyally follows the wielder’s verbal 
commands but is not intelligent and can only move, attack and perform 
simple tasks. Although the wielder’s control of the zombie is absolute, 
it is not long lived as the necromantic link becomes increasingly 
tenuous with each passing day. The wielder must roll 1d10 at dawn every 
day and if the rolled result is lower than the number of days the zombie
 has been animate, the undead breaks free of the wielder’s control and 
attempts to kill him at all costs. Only one zombie can be leashed to the
 blade at any time and if a secondary undead is created, the first one 
breaks free and attempts to kill the wielder.  —Note: In combat, the 
zombie acts on the turn immediately after the wielder and the DM can use
 wolf statistics for the undead’s equivalent statistics for hit points, 
attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of
 play, dire wolf or stronger undead’s statistics can be used to keep

 for as long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as 
Eth and Brensyl the Tall. The ancient blade is empowered with arcane 
magics that dampen sound and the wielder can force his victims to suffer
 in silence. The weapon makes no noise of any sort when it strikes a 
target and negates any sound the target would make as a result of being 
hit. A creature struck by the weapon cannot utter any sounds louder than
 a barely audible whisper until the start of the wielder’s next turn. 
While the sword is being wielded and for five minutes afterwards, the 
bearer cannot speak louder than a barely audible whisper. This does not 
hinder spellcasting (Unless the spell requires the target to hear the

rallying cries to allies, give instructions or shout for help. The 
forced whispering hinders the bearer’s ability to properly project their
 personality and they suffer disadvantage on all charisma based checks 
that rely on them speaking. —Note: In game terms only creatures within

he cannot stray farther than ten feet from it or take strenuous actions

their lethal potential function by sapping the wielder of his vitality

 it most. A wielder who rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll must roll 
damage as normal for the attack and half of the damage is dealt to the 
wielder, as the weapon seems to twist in their hands and nicks them.</p>

 that seems to hum with a comforting presence. It smells like the 
bearer’s mother’s cooking, feels like freshly laundered sheets, stings 
like a merciful executioner’s axe. The bearer is deeply comforted by the
 weapon despite the violence associated with its murderous use. When 
grasped and concentrated on in calm situations, the object shows the 
wielder his own childhood memories that are always of good times, fond 
events, or joyful occasions. Once per day, the bearer may lay this 
weapon beside a bowl of water. After a moment, the bowl of water will 
begin to boil and after a minute it will transform into a hot meal of 
special significance to the bearer, such as their mother’s noodle soup

flickers with barely contained power always threatening to burst free

truly remarkable attacks, a small portion of the untamed sorcery surges 
free causing unpredictable effects. Knowledgeable PC’s will be able to

solidified form of pure raw magic. Known also as wyrdstone, foulstone or
 witch-stone, the incredible rare substance is highly prized for its 
endless source of sorcerous power despite the heavy cost of life. 
Unrefined warpstone is highly toxic to all living things; prolonged 
exposure to the substance will lead to madness, mutation and eventual 
death. The supernatural radiation pouring from the mauls’ head poison’s 
the bearer’s form causing him to age twice as quickly as long as the 
weapon is on his person. The tainting effect upon the wielder’s flesh 
resonates with the warpstone, allowing the wielder to better direct the 
wild effects. Whenever the wielder lands a critical hit on an attack 
roll with the weapon, the player must roll twice on the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9704/">Wild Magic Surge Table</a>

 hit. While rolling on the table, the wielder is considered the “caster”

player roll on my homebrew tables of effects on this blog, the published
 Sorcerer’s <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9704/">Wild Magic Surge table</a>
 or any other random effect table you can find. Should the player roll 
on a result that would be grossly detrimental for the campaign (Such as 
casting Fireball at their own feet resulting in a TPK) the DM should

equivalent to an attack of opportunity (See Note) the wielder may 
attempt to parry an incoming melee, ranged or spell attack, increasing

hilt is missing. Traces of antique glue still stick to the narrower side
 of the blade. It is not removable. To hold the weapon the wielder must 
put his hands directly around the metal. It feels strangely fragile. 
Knowledgeable PC’s have heard that the sword is supposed to be as 
ancient as the world itself. It is said that it was cast in bronze by 
the first blacksmith and passed on to the first swordsman, with which 
they beheaded the first tyrant. No one can say exactly how old it is. 
Even in the earliest chronicles, it is already recorded as an ancient 
relic of a distant past. The sword drains the life force of everything 
nearby, causing it to wither and deteriorate and all creatures and 
objects within a five foot radius of Gilgamesh age twice as fast. A 
creature injured by the weapon instantly ages by a week for each point 
of damage dealt by the weapon and the wielder de-ages by one day for 
each point of damage dealt by the weapon. —Note: Although this 
enchantment should not have an impact on the duration of beneficial 
spells on the target or how long it’s been since they’ve last eaten, an 
intelligent PC or a lenient DM can find uses for it. Such as attacking 
summoned undead that only “live” for a day, aging them to a time where 
they crumble to dust or attacking monstrous insects, swarms, 
biologically unstable mutants, aberrations or other creatures that have 
lifespans in the weeks to months range.</p>

left behind when the wielder slides his fingers along it. Winter never 
penetrates the wielder’s bones again, as the blade draws in the chill to
 augment the wielder’s sword strokes with cool severity. The bearer’s 
thoughts turn into frost and his mood into ice. Whenever the wielder 
would take cold damage he can spend an action equivalent to an attack of
 opportunity to reduce the cold damage by the equivalent of a dagger 
(1d4) to a minimum of 0. After reducing the damage in this way, the

Underneath, the metal is dark from soot. Whoever fights with it leaves 
behind a constant trail of ashes. The hilt and sheath are both made of 
the damp, green wood of the Frinkel tree, which can never be set alight.
 Scenes of violence and torture are deeply carved into the wood. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard of the hellblade and know that 
Ainsbin was melted in the liquid rock of an active volcano and pressed 
with the help of the continental plates. An innocent man, condemned to 
death, put all his burning anger into the manufacturing process. A witch
 at the stake spoke the magic words. Driven by death and anger, it burns
 everything to ashes and smoke. As soon as the weapon is taken out of 
its sheath, it goes up in flames shedding light like a torch. The sword 
blade itself is always red-hot. Wounds are immediately cauterized after

Despite the extensive patina that slowly creeps along the blade, its

rotting flesh wafting off the blade can wield it to great effect. While 
holding the khopesh, the wielder can smell the direction of dead 
creatures within 100 feet as long as they died within the last week. If 
the wielder has used the weapon to kill a living creature within the 
past week, he can consume the spoiled or rotting flesh of animals and 
humanoids gaining nutrition without any negative effects or digestive 
issues as long as they have died within the past week. The blade 
accelerates the process of death and decay within the target causing 
open wounds to fester and spoil even if they’re only seconds old. 
Whenever the wielder successfully strikes a target who has less than 
half of their total hit points remaining, he inflicts necrotic damage

tip. If dipped into the blood of a living creature or fresh corpse, the 
hollow space inside will fill up by itself. Afterwards the glass 
sparkles for a few days in the reddish complexion of the juice of life. 
Upon successfully striking a creature, the wielder can use the weapon to
 form a metaphysical link between himself and the sample of blood within
 the blade. This connection allows the wielder to track down the rest of
 the blood and find the sample’s originator. Once per day when the 
wielder successfully attacks a creature he may choose to allow the sword
 to absorb a measure of blood within itself. For the next hour, as long 
as the weapon is in the wielder’s possession he is aware of the 
direction of that creature and gains advantage to any checks made to 
track, follow or find his target. If the sword is plunged into a freshly
 deceased creature (See Note) and remains there for at least one 
uninterrupted hour, it is treated as a +1 for 2d4 hours after being 
withdrawn from the body. During this time the weapon draws all the blood
 and general moisture from the corpse leaving it a desiccated husk when 
it is withdrawn. —Note: The creature should be no more than 12 hours 
dead, be the size of a wolf or larger and have possessed a blood based 
circulatory system while alive. The DM’s has discretion on what corpses 
qualify to feed the weapon’s hunger as some that have died due to fire 
or bleeding damage or who have been caught in explosions of power, may 
be too charred, mangled or lack enough blood for the weapon’s liking.</p>

Wrapped in red dragonhide, the grip ends in a pommel crafted of a 
three-inch-long dragon tooth. The wyrm’s fang still remembers the 
centuries of flaming breath that blasted over it and contains a fraction
 of that energy that can be unleashed upon one’s foes. When the wielder

belt-jewelry for a foppish noble. Closer examination, however, reveals 
the blade’s perfect balance, keen edge and a grip wrapped in wire that 
will not slip in a hand slick with sweat or blood. When the bearer 
grasps the hilt of the weapon, he feels a soft, warm breeze, scented 
with the smells of date palms and exotic spices, as though wafting from a
 desert bazaar. Only the bearer feels this breeze, which might cause an 
occasional ripple in his clothing or through his hair, but has no other 
effect. The steel practically thrummed with power, scarcely able to 
contain the sorceries placed upon it and strikes down enemies, slicing

this pulse steadies and brightens into a constant glow of brilliant 
yellow. A mundane bearer feels a great sense of approval and validation

barbaric design. The haft is carved from the thighbone of a dire lion 
and wrapped in dark red leather of questionable origin. Attached to the 
handle are long, thick leather cords, and at the end of each hangs a 
different bleached skull. Those who wield this tool of murder find their
 senses overlaid with rage and that their appetite for death and 
destruction surges with the weapon’s every blow. The weapon sparks a 
fiery bloodlust in the wielder but a creature who is already capable of 
inciting a primal frenzy in themselves, finds their battle prowess 
greatly magnified. Whenever the wielder enters a rage while wielding 
Skull Lash, the skulls on the end of the weapon roar in furious anger. A
 wielder who is raging, frenzied, rampaging or under a similar status 
effect, treats the flail as a +1 weapon.</p>

across the ground as if alive. With Flay in the bearer’s possession, he 
can taste food with his sense of smell. Like a snake, the whip can find 
the smallest gaps in to deliver a lethal strike. After a successful 
attack, the wielder deals additional damage equal to half of the 
attack’s result (Rounded down, minimum 0) that exceeded the target’s 
armor class. —Note: A combat example; The wielder got a 22 on the attack
 roll and the target’s AC is 18. The attack exceeds the target’s AC by 4
 and deals 2 additional points of damage.</p>

 once the weapon of a solar who shared the weapon’s name. The blade 
retains a commanding aura of goodness and power, but small aspects of 
the greatsword’s appearance can only be described as disturbing. The 
guard is blackened as if by an intense fire, and it is studded with 
cruel barbs wholly out of place on such a hallowed weapon. Celestial 
writing along the blade seems innocuous enough, but anyone who can read 
the language sees the words become foul blasphemies halfway to the 
sword’s tip. When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a
 selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens his urge to do so. The 
greatsword is treated as a +1 weapon when wielded by a creature of an 
evil alignment.</p>

quarterstaff made half from white ash as pure as fresh snow and half of 
darkwood so black it resembles a clouded sky on a moonless night. At the
 center of the staff, the two woods fuse together in a blend of neutral 
gray. The staff is unadorned, but simply holding it is enough to reveal 
its unusual properties. When left unattended, plants seem to grow and 
blossom with greater facility in the vicinity of the ash end, while 
vegetation is more prone to shriveling and withering near the darkwood 
end. The staff represent a magical balance of extremes and whenever the 
wielder makes a weapon damage roll, treat any die roll result of half or
 less as a “1” and any result higher than half of the maximum as having 
rolled the maximum result. —Note: If the damage dice for a quarterstaff 
is 1d8, a result of 1-4 will be changed to a 1 and a 5-8 will be treated
 as an 8.</p>

snowspider’s silk. When an arrow is nocked, the ammunition immediately 
lights up, shedding bright light for 15 feet, dim light for an 
additional 15 feet, and wafts thin streams of blue, rolling mist. This

weighting in the weapon’s handle that will occasionally make a mediocre 
attack strike true, almost as if the weapon had a mind of its own. The 
wielder scores a critical hit on a roll of a natural 7 with the weapon 
in addition to a natural 20. —Note: Not recommended for Ammunition or

bow constructed from a pair of staves woven together so expertly it 
appears a single, smooth, weapon. These two pieces were taken together, 
white and dark, and twisted together so intimately and tightly, they 
formed the single solid piece. Creatures injured by the weapon are 
sapped of their will to fight on despite overwhelming odds, finding 
their body unwilling to heal. Whenever a living creature damaged by the 
weapon would be healed (By any source, power or ability whatsoever), 
roll the amount healed twice and use the lower result. Should the 
creature instead be healed for a non rolled amount of hit points, reduce
 the healing by one point to a minimum of zero. This effect is short 
lived and only last until the start of the wielder’s next turn.</p>

holding the weapon the wielder feels the slightest bit of dissociation 
as if they’re not quite anchored in their own body. Whenever the wielder
 attacks with the bow, he can close his eyes after attacking and see 
through the tip of the arrow as it flies. For the next minute the 
wielder can see from the arrow’s location as if he was physically 
standing in its space. During this time the wielder is blind from his 
actual location but can end the effect at any time by opening his eyes. 
This property can be used twice per day.</p>

durable than normal, never breaks, chips or dulls as a result of casual 
use and is all but impossible to break or damage as a result of combat, 
even when targeted by enemies who attempt sundering or weapon breaking 
techniques. Once per hour as an action equivalent to an attack the

burnt steel which has been magically hardened to reduce weight and hold a
 sharper edge. The blade is adorned with beautifully crafted 
ornamentation and etchings of a twirling rose bush, and prominently 
features a blooming rose flower on the guard, and another on the pommel.
 The short hilt is loosely wrapped in a rose stem of dark softwood. The 
fine craftsmanship is accompanied by a magical enchantment and once per 
day as an action equivalent to drawing a weapon, the wielder can 
activate The Black Rose’s power. For the next minute, thorns grow from 
the hilt and green, viscous poison drips from the blade and whenever the
 wielder successfully strikes a target, he inflicts poison damage 
equivalent to a shortsword (1d6) in addition to the attack’s damage. 
This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

                <td><p>Spider’s Sting: A Random Sword with no hilt at 
all, just a simple flair to keep the wielder’s hand from slipping onto 
the blade. The blade is a fine steel that glints green in the light and 
gently curves towards the bearer. A weapon of odd arachnid design with 
the form of a lurking spider rising out of the flat pommel, a wielder 
must attune to it by closing his eyes and pressing the spider symbol 
against his forehead for a full minute. The wielder then becomes attuned
 for the next 24 hours and feels a metaphysical link to the sword and 
can extend that link to those harmed by it. Whenever the wielder 
successfully attacks a creature he can mark it with the sword’s magic, 
causing a pale green glow to surround the target which is only visible 
by the attuned wielder’s eyes. For the next hour the attuned wielder can
 see the glow of the marked creature even through walls or when blinded 
as long as they are within 300 feet of the wielder. The marked creature 
is never considered hidden, invisible or unseen to the attuned wielder 
even while in perfect darkness or concealed by illusions. The wielder 
can only have one creature marked at a time and when a new creature is 
marked, the link to the old target instantly fades. Attuning to the 
weapon weakens the bearer’s ability to resist toxins and an attuned 
wielder suffers disadvantage on any saving throws to against poison 
damage or being poisoned. Additionally while attuned, any spider can 
always see the bearer as if he was shrouded in the same pale glow.</p>
