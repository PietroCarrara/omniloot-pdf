        <div> 
            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

responds to the name “Lush” and introduces itself as such, seemingly 
unaware of the insulting connotation. Any wine stored in the skin will 
not spoil and stays fresh indefinitely. Lush refuses to be filled with 
anything other than some sort of fruit wine (Preferably grape) and spits
 out any other liquid immediately. The mouth of his face is also the 
spout of the skin, making drinking directly from the spout an awkward 
experience. Lush has a long history of experience with wine and can be 
convinced to render judgment or give a professional opinion on any wine 
he is filled with. This information grants proficiency and advantage to 
any checks involving; assessing how the wine was made, produced, stored,
 the conditions of the fruits growth, dryness, aftertaste and what food 
the wine would be well paired with. In short, Lush can function as a 
sommelier or wine steward, however he will only perform these duties 
when he contains a sample of the wine he is assessing. Lush can hold one
 gallon of liquid inside him and consumes one ounce of that wine per day
 which then disappears. Perhaps due to a fault of the enchantment or a 
quirk of the object, Lush seems to be personally effected by the alcohol
 he is filled with. In short, Lush is roaring drunk when he is full, 
begging for wine when he is low, hung over when he is empty and will 
drop into hibernation if the dry spell lasts more than three days and 
only awakes when completely refilled.</p>

 a Knowledge Geography, Memory, Intelligence or other similar check to

can take a deep breath and blow into the horn, taking an action 
equivalent to making a weapon attack or casting a spell. When used, the 
horn bellows a deep rumbling bass tone like a ship’s foghorn that can be
 heard up to a mile. Along with the sound, a cloud of fog comes out of 
the horn and completely obscures a ten-foot radius around the user. The 
cloud last for 12 seconds but can be renewed by blowing the horn again 
which also recreates the sound. The fog dissipates quickly if the horn 
is not blown again and can also be blown away by strong winds or burned 
off by large sources of fire. You get the feeling there was a breakdown 
in communication somewhere in the creation of this item about what its 
exact function was supposed to be.</p>

 user to see things behind him just as easily as objects directly in

 gain no special attack bonuses, as the creature is able watch them all 
simultaneously. Due to a faulty enchantment, an inexperienced artificer 
or simple oversight, the ring does not grant the bearer the needed 
sensory processing power to deal with the all-round vision. The bearer 
will suffer from vertigo, dizziness, and faint nausea on a near constant
 basis and will find it quite difficult to remain properly balanced. If 
the bearer moves more than half of his regular move speed he loses his 
equilibrium and falls prone. Should the ring be removed, the bearer’s 
sight instantly returns to normal however, he continues to suffer the 
vertigo and reduced speed for one minute while he readjusts to the 
change in visual perception. —Note: For example, if the bearer could 
move up to 30 feet in a round, he falls prone after moving 15 feet. A 
character who sacrifices other actions to gain more movement can take 
that movement but it would still be halved. For example, the bearer 
could move 15 feet then sacrifice his ability to attack this round 
(Gaining 30 feet of movement) and move another 15 feet.</p>

utter the command phrase “Mirror, mirror” which causes it to grow or

 new shape, stretching or condensing the mirror’s reflective surface 
forcing it into the alternate form. The mirror is perfectly reflective 
and seems to possess a deep quality as if viewer were staring into a 
deep body of water rather than a thin sheet of glass. The mirror has 
four different shapes: A palm sized compact, a hand mirror, a square 
mirror one-foot-wide and a full length mirror five feet tall by two feet
 wide. The square mirror naturally floats in the air at face level 
facing the creature that activated it, while the full length mirror 
floats three inches off of the ground. Both can be commanded to hover in
 any place or face in any direction within five feet of the user and 
neither can hover while supporting additional weight. The mirror reverts
 back into its compact form and places itself safely on the ground if it
 strays more than five feet from its user, the user goes more than one 
minute without looking at his reflection or if it is physically harmed. 
Should the mirror be damaged, it instantly curls and retracts back into 
its compact form like an injured animal and refuses to open or shift 
forms for one week.</p>

user gains the ability to perform various alcohol related mixing, 
pouring, stacking, and juggling tricks flawlessly regardless of their 
individual dexterity or ability. Although practical limitations such as 
missing fingers or hands may stop the tricks from going smoothly. 
However, these abilities are not without limitation: While connected to

grunt or ask generic stock questions such as “what will it be?” “What 
are you having?” or “What’s your poison?”. The user must fill any drink

attention to his client’s drunken ramblings. If the user isn’t actively 
making a drink, he will unconsciously use the Rag to clean the nearest 
available cup, mug, glass or whatever flat surface is currently passing 
for a bar. If the user fails in any of these tasks, he is immediately 
stricken with the worst hangover of his life which gradually fades of 
the next 24 hours. The user may not establish a connection to the Rag 
again for seven days after failing to follow the Rag’s rules. The user 
may break the connection without penalty only if he is relieved by any 
other bartender or one hour after announcing “last call”, which he may

effect at will but must wait for one hour before activating it again.  </p>

 small nibble marks that appears to having something moving inside of 
it. It appears that the pouch has been routinely repaired as stitching 
of various age and wear is quite noticeable. The pouch feels ice cold to
 touch regardless of the ambient temperature. Inside is an skeletal 
mouse whose bones are covered in arcane unmelting ice. The undead mouse 
will follow whoever carries the pouch, as well as following the bearer’s
 basic commands. The mouse understands its bearer’s spoken words but 
cannot speak or understands the words of other creatures and is only as 
intelligent as a particularly smart mouse. The ice will melt if the 
mouse goes further than 50 feet from the pouch leaving an inanimate 
skeleton. To revive the familiar, the bones must be left in the pouch 
for 72 hours and which time it is brought back to unlife.</p>

                <td><p>Gambler’s Cuff Links: A pair of matched silver 
cuff links bearing the icons of a pair of dice on a playing card. They 
have been possessed by the soul of a career gambler and notoriously 
honest man. Wearing the cuff links on an outwardly visible part of the 
body imparts the bearer with the gambler’s memories and skills. The 
bearer gains the knowledge of the exact rules and variations of the 
rules for a myriad of dice and card games. The bearer knows the rules 
and strategies instinctively as if they had played those games since 
childhood. The bearer is also able to perform card, dice and various 
related sleight of hand tricks flawlessly regardless of their individual
 dexterity or ability, although practical limitations such as missing 
fingers or hands may stop the tricks from going smoothly. However, these
 abilities are not without limitation: These memories and skills are 
only accessible in the context of a bet or wager of cards or dice when 
money or valuables are being staked. Furthermore the bearer may never 
cheat or benefit in any way from cheating while using the cuff links. If
 the bearer ever cheats (either to benefit themselves or another person)
 or knowingly benefits from another person cheating on their behalf the 
cuff links cease to function for him until that bet is squared away and 
repaid in full. —Note: The bearer is allowed to bluff at cards, 
misdirect his opponent, bend the spirit of the rules while remaining in 
the letter of them and so forth without penalty, but he may never use 
marked cards, stack the deck in any player’s favor, lie about or 
outright break the rules, hide cards up his sleeve, use loaded dice, 
receive outside help, etc.  </p>

                <td><p>Goodberry Pouch: A long travel pouch crafted from
 woven strips birch bark and vibrantly colored leaves. Despite the 
absence of roots or any kind of basic sap circulatory system, small 
fruits are growing on both the inside and outside of the satchel. If the
 pouch is provided a pint of water and an hour of sunlight a day, it 
will yield 1d6+1 berries per week which will regrow if harvested. The 
satchel will maintain a total of seven ripe berries if the bearer 
doesn’t harvest it. Consuming a berry gives the creature a mild euphoric
 feeling, heals 1 hit point of damage and are as nutritious and filling 
as eating an entire meal. The plucked berries lose their effects 12 
hours after being removed from the pouch and a creature cannot benefit 
from their effects more than once per 24-hour period. If the pouch goes 
more than three days without adequate water and sunlight, all its 
berries shrivel and die and the satchel enters a dormant state. A 
dormant pouch must be provided with eight consecutive uninterrupted 
hours of sunlight along with a gallon of water at which point it resumes
 normal functioning.  </p>

                <td><p>Hag Finger: A shriveled green finger that is warm
 to touch and covered in a thick layer of perpetual slime and algae. The
 finger once belonged to a type of malevolent fey known as a hag and the
 digit retains the faint memories of its full form. A creature can place
 the finger in their mouth and suck on the toxic slime which infuses 
their body with illusionary magic. A few moments after swallowing the 
virulent algae, the magic causes the user to look like a bent old woman 
with matted white hair, sinewy arms and rotted green teeth. The use of 
the finger comes with some practical limitations as it must remain in 
the user’s mouth constantly while the slime is consumed or the magic 
instantly fails. This makes it quite difficult to speak properly and 
nearly impossible to cast spells that require verbal components. The 
user suffers disadvantage on any checks requiring fluent speech (Such as
 diplomacy, singing, bluff or some intimidation checks) and a 75% chance
 that a spell requiring speech will fail. Furthermore, whenever the user
 first places the finger in their mouth and after every ten minutes of 
constant use, the user suffers 1 point of poison damage as the toxic 
algae enters their system.</p>

expertly carved and painted to look like a maid. When the command word 
is spoken, the carving springs to live and can be commanded by its 
activator to perform simple domestic tasks (Such as: sweep the floor, 
clean the dishes or darn socks) which it will perform until it becomes 
too damaged to function, ordered to do otherwise or the job is 
completed. The figurine can only be given one task at a time and works 
diligently on whatever its last command was. The statuette can exert up 
to 20 pounds of force but cannot under any circumstances, directly or 
indirectly cause harm to a creature. If multiple House Helpers are given
 the same goal they will actively work together to achieve it.  </p>
