(See Note) but his maximum lifespan is also shortened by twice that 
amount to fuel the chronomagical effect. The drinker is granted youth at
 the cost of his senior years, essentially borrowing time against 
himself. —Note: A DM may rule that this number is multiplied by 10 for 
longer lived races such as dwarves, elves or gnomes.</p>

hollow tube of crystallized sand. Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize the 
material as fulgurite, which is formed when lighting strikes loose sand,
 fusing the individual grains together into a solid object. The glassy 
wand is surprisingly firm and durable despite its fragile appearance. 
Small bolts of lightning flicker intermittently within the opaque tube. 
On the wielder’s turn he can target a creature he can see within 60 feet
 and activate the wand as an action equivalent to attacking or casting a
 spell, causing the wand’s interior to storm and flash with energy that 
audibly crackles and sparks then releases a small bolt of lightning. The
 wand is perfectly accurate at close range and if the target is within 
5-30 feet the creature suffers lighting damage equivalent to a dagger 
plus the wielder’s character level (1d4+level) and half that damage if 
the target is 35-60 feet from the wielder.</p>

crudely carved into the likeness of a fierce badger. The tale behind 
this item tells of a ranger who made an enemy of a mighty wizard. To 
punish her he cursed her treasured companion, Barryat, into the form of a
 useless trinket. But such was his devotion to his master, that in the 
face of battle, Barryat will fight his wooden prison and attempt to join
 the fray. Whenever the bearer, or a friendly creature within ten feet 
of him, rolls a natural 20 on an initiative roll, the totem transforms 
into a ferocious giant badger (Use wolf statistics if giant badger’s are
 not available). Barryat takes his turn immediately after the bearer and
 acts as the bearer’s ally, defending him and his allies until death. He
 understands simple verbal combat instructions (Such as; Attack that 
one, defend me, run away, etc.) but cannot take complex actions or use 
objects. After one minute, or if Barryat is reduced to 0 hit points, he 
reverts back to an undamaged wooden figurine.</p>

 identical sealed glass vials containing sludgy black liquid. In the 
distant past mages working with monster hunters developed this potion 
specifically for use in fighting cemetery and crypt dwellers that drink 
the blood or eat the innards of their still living victims. Hunters tend
 to use Black Blood unwillingly because the potion only works when a 
monster begins to feast on their body which is rarely the best strategy.
 When consumed, Black Blood contaminates the imbiber’s blood causing the
 drinker to suffer a dagger’s worth of poison damage (1d4) and any 
creature who bites the drinker or drinks his blood suffers two 
shortswords worth of acid damage (2d6). This effect lasts for one hour.</p>

conductor’s baton. It looks like it has been lovingly maintained. When 
one or more other creatures within 50 feet of the bearer that he can see
 are performing a musical number of some sort, the bearer can assist by 
waving the wand to direct them. As long as the bearer spends his action 
each round to conduct the performers, each musician or vocalist can add 
1d6 to the result of their performance check.</p>

                <td><p>Solvent Staff: A six-foot staff made of a single 
piece of incredibly pitted and rusted iron. The staff may have been well
 made, covered in arcane runes or etched with intricate designs at one 
time, however nothing but varying shades of rust currently decorates the
 implement. The metal is rough and sharp to the touch, leaving the 
wielder’s hands rust stained and blemished as if exposed to a weak acid.
 Sizable pieces of rust occasionally flake off of the staff, 
disintegrating when they hit the ground but the arcane implement never 
seems to reduce in size or weight no matter how much is lost. The 
implement is infused with metamagic power, allowing the wielder to use 
it as a spellcasting focus and to translate aspects of certain spells 
into more desirable results. Twice per day when the wielder casts a 
spell that deals damage, he can filter the magic through the staff to 
convert 100% of that damage to acid.</p>

 glass eye embedded in the center. To use the wondrous item, the user 
must attune to the trinket by pressing it to their forehead for one 
minute with his eyes closed. The Eye can only be attuned to one creature
 at once and when a new being attunes to it, the old connection is 
broken. While the trinket is within 120 feet, its attuned user can use 
an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell to close his eyes 
and see through the Eye of the Watchers as if he was standing in that 
spot. During this time, the user is deaf and blind to his own senses. At
 any time he can use an action equivalent to attacking or casting a 
spell to swap between his senses and the Eye’s. If an effect would cause
 the Eye to become blinded, the user is also blinded for the duration. 
The trinket can be accurately thrown a number of feet equal to three 
times the bearer’s strength score.</p>

                <td><p>Bottled Banshee: A fist sized globe of 
crystal-clear glass, that appears to be empty except for a thin fog 
constantly swirling around inside. The vessel contains the last whispers
 of a banshee, captured moments before its final cessation of existence.
 As an action equivalent to an attack, the bearer can throw the bottle 
accurately against a creature or an empty five foot square within 30 
feet. Upon impact it shatters, releasing a deafeningly loud, 
blood-chilling scream that can temporarily incapacitate even the 
strongest willed being. The wraith’s wail of death deals 1d12 thunder 
damage and 1d12 necrotic damage to all creatures within a 15 foot radius
 centered on the target creature or space. If the Bottled Banshee deals 
more thunder damage than necrotic, all creatures within the area of 
effect are deafened until the start of the wielder’s next turn. If the 
bottled banshee deals more necrotic damage than thunder, all creatures 
within the area of effect are frightened until the start of the 
wielder’s next turn. If the damage rolls are the same, both effects 
occur.</p>
</td>
                
            </tr>

                <td><p>Quantum Vial: A large sealed glass vial 
containing a thick clear gelatin that is cushioning a secondary sealed 
glass vial. The outer vial’s glass is faintly etched in arcane glyphs 
relating to divination and teleportation and its stopper is fashioned of
 precisely carved black slate that widens significantly at the opening. 
Written in chalk on the outer stopper is a concise and accurate 
description of the inner vial’s contents. The smaller inner vial is a 
fairly commonplace four ounce container of clear glass, sealed with a 
stopper and would not be out of place in an adventurer’s backpack, an 
alchemist’s shop or a chef’s spice rack. Every day at dawn, if the outer
 vial contains a smaller vial surrounded by protective gelatin and is 
properly sealed, the inner vial changes to a different <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9738/">Random Glass Vial</a><a href="https://tabletoptrinketsbyjj.tumblr.com/post/187124693892/all-sealed-glass-vials-a-working-rolling-table-of">.</a>
 The outer vial can be unsealed at any time which allows the bearer to 
access the inner vial but causes the gelatin to quickly evaporate. To 
get the Quantum Vial working again after being unsealed, the bearer 
needs to put in a new inner vial (Which can be empty or full), replace 
the gelatin and reseal the outer vial. Creating the gelatin and forming 
an airtight seal requires proficiency in alchemist’s tools, costs about 
10 gold pieces in materials and takes roughly one hour of work.</p>

                <td><p>Shifting Staff: A strange and peculiar staff that
 changes its appearance, coloring, weight, and even size, randomly. It 
can be smooth and cold to the touch one second then hot and ruggedly 
textured the next. Its weight randomly fluctuates between that of a 
feather’s, to that of a hefty war-hammer. Unpredictably growing as large
 as a quarterstaff, while shrinking to be as small as a wand on an 
inconsistent basis. Different colors appear and disappear, swirling 
about within and around it, periodically emanating strange weave-like 
patterns of tangled light that are seemingly stuck to it. Knowledgeable 
PC’s will be able to determine that the implement is a shard of 
crystallized wild magic and although it will empower spells cast through
 it, it is entirely unreliable from one spell to the next. The implement
 is infused with a <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Random Metamagic Power</a>
 allowing the wielder to use it as a spellcasting focus and to alter the
 essence of spells. The wielder can activate the staff while casting a 
spell in order to augment the spell with the Metamagic power that the 
focus is attuned to. After being activated, the wand’s metaphysical 
harmony changes randomly and the wielder rolls on the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Unique Metamagic Options table</a>
 and the implement becomes attuned to that bonus instead. The staff uses
 the wielder’s own power to fuel this effect and he chooses to either 
burn his supernatural energy which causes the spell to use an additional
 spell slot of the same level or higher (Minimum level 1) or drain his 
physical health suffering a dagger’s worth of unpreventable hit point 
damage (1d4) per level of the spell (Minimum 1d4).</p>

the ground but always hovering just an inch above the dirt. The stylish 
garment is woven of fine silk and adorned with patterns of gusts and 
wind. The gossamer fabric can lend its lightweight property to its 
bearer for a few moments, allowing him to step into the sky as easily as
 a leaf on the wind. Twice per day as an action equivalent to attacking

 benefit works only for a few moments and the bearer will fall if he 
ends his turn in the air and nothing else is holding him aloft. The

heavily damaged, sporting a multitude of scratches, dents, chips, rents

 he can target a creature he can see within 60 feet and activate the 
wand as an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell. The horn 
then draws in light and warmth from the area around it for a few moments
 as if attempting to corrupt the very nature of the world and releases a
 twisted ray of pure darkness at its target. The wand is perfectly 
accurate at close range and if the target is within 5-30 feet the 
creature suffers necrotic damage equivalent to a dagger plus the

Knowledgeable PC’s know that the dwarven master-smith Tergaunt of 
Solanos Mor is remembered both for his skill and as a cautionary tale. 
Like many of his brethren, he was dedicated to crafting the perfect item

crafting process intolerable. He turned his prodigious skill toward 
time-saving devices. One of his greatest successes was the creation of 
the Apron of the Artificer, thus saving precious minutes by avoiding 
having to search for the right tool in a cluttered workshop. Ironically,
 Tergaunt’s obsession with creating time-saving magic items consumed 
him, and he died without ever attempting to craft his perfect

 a specific location which he must have visited, and a recipient who 
matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the

 recipient at about two miles per hour, with a maximum range of 50 miles
 in a single direction. If the swarm finds the creature the wielder 
describes, it delivers the message in a hoarse voice that sounds of 
retching. When the hundreds of flies have completed their task, they 
burrow into the recipient’s flesh, dealing the equivalent of a dagger of
 piercing damage (1d4) and vanish once inside. The swarm speaks only to a
 creature matching the description the wielder gave and should it fail

 with two pairs of most of the implements as if it is meant to be used

initially surprising, the barely visible being is nothing but helpful, 
existing to serve as the crafter’s assistant as best it can. At first 
the bearer must command the servant verbally but as time goes by being 
becomes more familiar with the bearer’s routines and desires and is able
 to understand grunts and gestures and finally after some weeks together
 never needs any instruction, working in perfectly synchronicity with 
the bearer as if it was a natural extension of his body. The being is 
just as proficient and skilled as the crafter and can hold and 
manipulate tools and perform tasks essentially functioning as a second 
pair of hands, dramatically raising productivity. The bearer must be 
actively working and focusing on the tools for the servant to function 
and the bearer is always treated as if he was being helped by another 
creature as skilled as he is. Whenever the bearer makes a skill or 
crafting check related to the artisan’s tools that would benefit from 
having a second person helping to complete the task, he makes the roll 
with advantage. With two people working on a project the work progresses
 much faster and whenever the bearer uses the tools to craft or alter an
 item or object, he can do it in half the usual time. The helper can 
also work independently of the bearer (Should the crafter lack hands or 
be allergic to the materials for example) but this requires the bearer 
to be within ten feet and be completely focused on the task.</p>

have heard rumors that these wondrous items were first commissioned for a
 pompous and fastidious Altherian noble who found the smell of horses 
offensive and the thought of tending to such a beast beneath his 
station. Any bearer capable of reading can hold the saddle and utter the
 incantation written on the saddle. Over the course of one minute as the
 bearer completes the ritual, a large, quasi-real, horselike creature 
forms under the saddle, summoned from the astral plane. The phantom 
steed has a black head and body, grey mane and tail, and smoke-colored, 
insubstantial hooves that make no sound. The mount obeys the verbal 
instructions of whoever summoned it and can ride over sandy, muddy, or 
even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed. The steed 
can be summoned for a maximum of 8 hours per day, disappearing suddenly 
the moment that time is up. These hours do not need to be consecutive, 
but must be spent in 1-hour increments. The steed uses the statistics 
for a riding horse with the expedition that it cannot attack and does 
not naturally regain hit points. If the mount ever drops to zero hit 
points, the creature disappears in a puff of smoke and the player rolls a
 d20 and on a 1, the saddle’s connection to the astral plane is 
permanently broken and the phantom steed can never be summoned again. 
Any bearer capable of reading can utter the summoning ritual backwards 
over the course of a minute which will dismiss the steed early without 
risk.</p>

Furthermore, the poison is so precisely made to kill X that it does not 
even register as a poison when viewed by spells that detect poison 
unless the caster himself is X. A bearer who is proficient in a 
poisoner’s toolkit can mix the liquid with stabilizing reagents so that 
the adverse effects will be delayed once it’s consumed or introduced to 
the victim’s bloodstream. A proficient bearer can spend one hour and ten
 gold pieces of materials in order to rig the poison so that its toxic 
effect is delayed from one minute to up to eight hours once it’s 
introduced to the victim’s system. The bearer makes the choice of the

and death in the language of demons. The horn itself is hideous and 
heavily damaged, sporting a multitude of scratches, dents, chips, rents 
and other patterns of wear. A creature holding the staff is instilled 
with the certainty that everything in life or death is theirs to command
 if they can shrug off their ethical and moral compunctions and reach 
out to take what they want, whenever they want it. When activated, the 
horn draws in light and warmth from the area around it for a few moments
 as if attempting to corrupt the very nature of the world. The implement
 is infused with a <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Random Metamagic Power</a>
 that allows the wielder to use it as a spellcasting focus and to alter 
the essence of spells tied to its nature. The wielder can activate the 
staff while casting a spell that deals only necrotic damage to augment 
the spell with the Metamagic power that the implement is attuned to. The
 staff uses the wielder’s own power to fuel this effect and he chooses 
to either burn his supernatural energy which causes the spell to use an 
additional spell slot of the same level or higher (Minimum level 1) or 
drain his physical health suffering a dagger’s worth of unpreventable 
hit point damage (1d4) per level of the spell (Minimum 1d4). A bearer 
capable of casting spells can adjust the Metamagic formula during the 
course of a delicate one-hour ritual. At the end of the procedure the 
player rolls a d20 and on a 1, the bearer causes the supernatural 
architecture to collapse and the focus mutates into a swarm of flies and
 is destroyed. If the implement survives, the bearer rolls randomly on 
the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Metamagic Options table</a> and can either choose to keep the current Metamagic power or change it to the new one.</p>

                <td><p>Tome of the White Hand: A blue leather-bound book
 imprinted with a white hand. It is wrapped in black velvet cloth and 
bound with glistening silver twine. The tome contains extensive 
instructions on creating circles of extraplanar protection and how to 
summon demons from the Abyss to the material plane to be bound into 
service. Oddly enough the book provides graphic warnings on the dangers 
of doing so and large sections of the book are devoted to prayers and 
meditations to be carried out to cleanse the reader’s mind and soul 
before and after completing a fiendish summoning. Through the use of the
 book, a bearer can burn ten gold pieces worth of incense in order to 
summon a minor demon and bind it to himself for use as a familiar. The 
summoned imp is forced to be loyal to the bearer and cannot act against 
him directly or indirectly. However if the summoner dies while the imp 
is summoned, the devil is freed to act on its own desires. Knowledgeable
 PC’s will recognize this tome was penned by a clerical order devoted to
 subduing fiends by any means possible. A large part of their training 
is the actual summoning and binding of demons to use them to kill other 
demons and extract their truenames in order to destroy them utterly and 
permanently. Their philosophy of fighting hellfire with hellfire is a 
fringe school of thought and is considered zealous at best and outright 
heresy at worst.</p>

effectively creating an untouchable, free floating tube of liquid blood.
 When left unattended or held by a mundane creature, the blood sloshes 
around against the interior of the staff but is otherwise dormant. When 
held by a mage or creature capable of casting magic spells, the blood 
boils in its confined space and the wielder can feel the magic power

 that allows the wielder to use it as a spellcasting focus and to alter 
the essence of spells tied to its nature. The wielder can activate the 
staff while casting a spell that deals only force damage to augment the 
spell with the Metamagic power that the implement is attuned to. The 
staff uses the wielder’s own power to fuel this effect and he chooses to
 either burn his supernatural energy which causes the spell to use an 
additional spell slot of the same level or higher (Minimum level 1) or 
drain his physical health suffering a dagger’s worth of unpreventable 
hit point damage (1d4) per level of the spell (Minimum 1d4). A bearer 
capable of casting spells can adjust the Metamagic formula during the 
course of a delicate one-hour ritual. At the end of the procedure the 
player rolls a d20 and on a 1, the bearer causes the supernatural 
architecture to collapse and the focus spills out all the blood and is 
destroyed. If the implement survives, the bearer rolls randomly on the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/42757/">Metamagic Options table</a> and can either choose to keep the current Metamagic power or change it to the new one.</p>

can be smooth and cold to the touch one second then hot and ruggedly 
textured the next. Its weight randomly fluctuates between that of a 
feather’s, to that of a hefty war-hammer. Unpredictably growing as large
 as a quarterstaff, while shrinking to be as small as a wand on an 
inconsistent basis. Different colors appear and disappear, swirling 
about within and around it, periodically emanating strange weave-like 
patterns of tangled light that are seemingly stuck to it. Knowledgeable 
PC’s will be able to determine that the staff is a shard of crystallized
 wild magic and that its nature corrupts spells cast through it, 
infusing them with chaotic power. The staff can be used as a 
spellcasting focus and the wielder can choose to channel additional 
power through the implement in order to trigger an outpouring of 
uncontrolled magic, allowing the player to immediately roll on the <a href="https://chartopia.d12dev.com/chart/9704/">Wild Magic Surge Table</a>

physical health suffering a dagger’s worth of unpreventable hit point

 the published Sorcerer’s Wild Magic Surge table or any other random 
effect table you can find. Should the player roll on a result that would
 be grossly detrimental for the campaign (Such as casting Fireball at 
their own feet resulting in a TPK) the DM should feel free to have the

polished, showing no signs of wear and tear, as if it was only recently 
removed from its former owner. The fang is so immense that a perceptive 
PC can actually see the venom channel at the tip of the fang. A single 
bloated drop of venom rests at the end of the channel in a perpetual 
state of near drip. A creature holding the wand feels an unpleasant warm
 tingling sensation in their hand, as if a fraction of its power somehow
 penetrated the wielder’s skin. When activated, the wand spits the drop 
of venom from the tip of the fang, penetrating the target’s skin, 
poisoning them from within. On the wielder’s turn he can target a 
creature he can see within 60 feet and activate the wand as an action 
equivalent to attacking or casting a spell. The wand is perfectly 
accurate at close range and if the target is within 5-30 feet the 
creature suffers poison damage equivalent to a dagger plus the wielder’s
 character level (1d4+level) and half that damage if the target is 35-60
 feet from the wielder.</p>

15 feet, causing the target to regain hit points equivalent to a 
dagger’s damage die plus the wielder’s character level (1d4+level) as 
they feel a rejuvenating burst of vitality surge through them. The 
wand’s artificial healing is short lived and fades suddenly like the 
crash of a powerful stimulant, leaving the target worse off than before.
 One minute after being healed, the target suffers unpreventable hit 
point damage equal to the amount the wand healed. If this damage reduces
 the creature to zero hit points or less, the target also becomes 
exhausted as if it had gone a night without rest. Only a perceptive PC 
will notice that this isn’t a true healing wand unless they actually use
 it. —Note: This is considered a cursed item for the purposes of any

it through its core, making it nearly impossible to use as a weapon. A 
creature holding the wand can feel the painful whip strong force of the 
willow switch encased within the emasculating sheath of the rubber. On 
the wielder’s turn he can target a creature he can see within 60 feet

wielder. This effect leaves no visible marks of injury or damage, nor 
will it ever directly kill the target. If a target would take enough 
damage from the spell to render them unconscious or dead, they instead 
drop to 1 hit point, remain conscious and become exhausted as if they 
had gone a night without sleeping. This fatiguing effect is cumulative 
and the wielder is able to exhaust a target to death with enough effort,
 leaving a corpse with no marks of injury or apparent cause of death.</p>
