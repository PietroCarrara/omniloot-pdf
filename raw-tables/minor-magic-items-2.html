        <div> 
            <p>Also known as not-quite-wondrous items, common magic 
items, utility and niche magical equipment, underpowered relics or 
depowered artifacts, these objects are essentially cantrips and weak 
magic spells in physical form. Useful for more than just combat, these 
items create light, entertain, clean, play music, flavor food, heat, 
cool, warn, inform and generally raise the quality of life for their 
bearers. They can act as unique world building items, magic shop filler 
objects, barter and trade goods as well as ingredients to create or 
upgrade stronger magic items or enchantments.</p>

 strung on a silver chain. When held, the stone gives off a sense of 
familiarity, warmness and belonging. When worn, the gemstone will 
vibrate if a blood relative is within 100 feet of the bearer. —Note: For
 the item’s purposes, “blood relative” extents as far as 
great-grandparents, great-grandchildren and second cousins but not more 
distant relations. This is of course up to the DM’s discretion.  </p>

depicting a caricature of a humanoid face twisted into an open-mouthed 
smile. The too-wide rictus grin makes the face appear more manic than 
happy, as if it was unable to control its expression. Whenever a 
creature within 15 feet of the bearer (Including the bearer) begins to 
laugh (Even just a snicker), that creature continues to laugh 
uncontrollably for the next six seconds. This forced laughter does not 
necessarily carry the same emotional significance as the original laugh 
and can begin to sound hysteric as the creature realizes that they are 
unable to stop. Although creatures can resist the effect simply by not 
chuckling to begin with, or exerting by their willpower to remain calm 
after being subjected to the amulet’s effects, laughter can be 
insidiously contagious and hearing others giggle uncontrollably can set 
off even the most stoic of folk. A laughing creature suffers any logical
 penalties to speaking or casting spells with verbal components but can 
breathe regularly during the cackling fit. The amulet must be worn for 
it to function and all effects cease the moment that it is removed.</p>

crystal will change to match the type of weather, becoming a dark and 
murky grey color for rain, opaque white for snowstorms, black with

command word which causes it to fly around its owner and starting 
hunting and slaughtering any normal insects that are within 30 feet of 
its activator. The wasp is incapable of hurting anything other than the 
insects it is hunting. It prioritizes targets with venom, stingers and 
those capable of flight. Between the wasp’s steel mandibles, pin sized 
stinger, fear aura and tireless rampage, the general area around the 
user is kept clear of pests. When the command word is spoken again, the 
wasp returns to the activator and becomes dormant.</p>

nest, that always feels warm to the touch. When empty, the object is 
large enough to accommodate a single falcon’s egg and changes in changes
 in shape and size to accommodate any egg smaller than one foot in 
diameter. The nest will perfectly incubate any egg (Avian, reptile, 
amphibian, fish, insect etc.) that is placed within it, providing the 
optimal conditions for the development of the fetus regardless of 
outside the temperature or conditions. If the egg has been incubated by 
the nest for the majority of its development, it has a 99% chance of 
hatching into a perfectly healthy specimen of its species, which will 
then imprint on the first creature it sees. The imprinted creature gains
 a permanent advantage on any checks made to train or handle the animal.
 The nest does not reduce incubation time and can only effect one egg at
 a time.</p>

sack that smells faintly of farmyard excrement. Each day the sack can

 no disease, parasites or pathogens and can serve as a rich fertilizer. 
The dried manure will easily serve as fuel for campfires if one can

 consumed, the creature experiences a deep heartbreaking sorrow which 
smothers any existing feelings (Magical and mundane) of infatuation, 
lust and romantic love. Drinking this antidote will instantly dispel the
 magical effects of any love potion, glamor, bewitchment or magic spell 
that has enchanted or charmed the imbiber. The resulting melancholy 
grants the creature advantage on saves against those same types of 
spells and effects, but imposes disadvantage on persuasion, seduction or
 diplomacy checks made against all creatures the imbiber would normally 
be romantically or sexually attracted to. All the liquid’s effects fade

 grey liquid that emits a sickly sweet metallic odor when uncorked. If 
consumed, the drinker becomes terrified of the first living creature 
they see immediately thereafter. The mere thought of that creature will 
cause panic attacks and a terrible blunt headache. The imbiber will make
 all efforts to escape or hide from the creature they fear. The drinker 
becomes too filled with dread to attack the creature unless they are 
attacked first, at which point they may defend themselves until an 
opportunity to escape presents itself. All the effects fade after 24 
hours and never cause the drinker to violate any of their strongly held 
ethics or morals.  </p>

                <td><p>Trick Cards: An ornate leather case containing a 
deck of masterfully carved, thin wooden playing cards which have been 
expertly painted and lacquered. The cards are animated and can be 
ordered to perform a number of tricks on command, such as shuffling, 
dealing itself out, or displaying a certain card. The cards can also be 
ordered to remain in place in the air, allowing each playing to have 
their hand hover in front of them, float over to another player or drift
 down to a discard pile. A player could also order a card to draw itself
 and float over to him or discard a card by issuing verbal commands such
 as “Draw” or “Discard the far-left card”. The deck is perfect for small
 children who cannot yet hold cards properly, adults who’s hands or 
occupied with food or drink or areas where there are no clean flat 
surfaces. The deck can be taught up to five tricks or routines (It 
already knows a basic rifle shuffle and how to deal out cards neither of
 which count against the five tricks) such as shuffling in a distinctive
 pattern, shuffling and leaving a certain card as the top card, playing a
 game against itself, arranging itself in a distinctive order or even to
 float around a creature creating a rotating halo or bracelet of cards. 
Any creature can teach the deck a new trick by describing the action to 
the deck and choosing which other trick must be forgotten. The 
activation of these tricks can be linked to any command word or sentence
 chosen when the trick is taught to the deck. If an individual card 
strays more than ten feet from the majority of the deck it will attempt 
to float back to the others.</p>

spider made of shiny reflective steel that can be fit with one small 
candle. Fitted overtop of one of the arachnid’s eight legs is a plain 
steel ring. If the ring is removed and donned by a creature, the bearer 
can telepathically control the spider up to a distance of 30 feet. The

transformative. The coin’s faces can be interacted with and stand up to

arcane markings. Each sheet of paper is a religious prayer to the living
 spirits known as kami that manifest themselves in every physical object
 but are hidden from the world. The sheets are formal prayers made 
specifically to doors, locks and portals, and humbly request that those 
kami remain shut for as long as possible. The seals are activated by 
placing one of the sheets on a door, sliding wall, gate, hatch or other 
form of entry or exit and closing one’s eyes for a moment out of 
respect. The parchment magically adheres itself to the door and the 
writing begins to glow softly. The portal instantly closes and locks 
itself if that was not already the case. While the seal prayer is in 
place, all creatures attempting to break down the door or pick the lock 
suffer disadvantage on all related checks to do so as the spirits of the
 door itself lend to its material strength. While the seal is active, a 
proper key only has a 25% chance of working correctly as the locking 
mechanism shifts and warps in place. All of these effects continues 
until the parchment is destroyed or removed (It is as durable as mundane
 parchment) or until the door is opened. Once used, the prayer can never
 be used again.</p>

energy based on the selection of the dials, and can be used as a cheap 
decoy or distraction to those capable of detecting magic. The aura 
causes the amulet to detect as a magical item that matches the dial

moral alignment (Good / Evil / Lawful / Chaotic / Neutral) of the aura.

Fey, Fel, Elemental, Primal, Divine, Arcane, Psychic, Mystical,

probing tentacles and wicked fangs. The creature’s eyes are made from 
deep green emeralds and seem to glimmer with alien intelligence. When a 
creature first touches the medallion, its eyes glow green and an 
unsettling energy trickles into the creature from item. Over the next 
week (If the medallion remains in the creature’s possession) the bearer 
will see occasional movement in the corners of his eyes and become more 
suspicious of other creatures and his general surroundings. After a full
 week in the bearer’s possession he will require one less hour of sleep 
per day in order to gain full rested benefits. During that extra hour of
 wakefulness the bearer’s thoughts always drift to the figure on the 
medallion and its alien shape. During this time the bearer can stand 
watch, move around, perform light reading or menial tasks etc. but can 
not perform any task that require meaningful concentration. For each 
additional week that the medallion stays in the bearer’s possession he 
will require one less hour of sleep per week to a maximum of only 
needing half of his normal amount of sleep per day. Once the maximum has
 been reached the bearer’s obsession also reaches a maximum. The bearer 
will begin to hear whispers from the medallion and experience delusions 
that he can bring the figure into the world through prayer or sacrifice.
 He becomes loath to part with the medallion for any reason and will 
always have it touching his skin or on his person. He begins to 
unconsciously speak aloud to the medallion or to himself about his plans
 to summon the eldritch being, regardless of who’s around to witness 
this behavior. If the medallion and bearer are separated by at least 
five feet for a period of at least 24 hours all of the effects instantly
 fade. This leaves the former bearer lethargic but clear headed.</p>

 continuous as long as the ring remains worn. The band is not easily 
removed and embeds itself into the corpse-like skin. It can only be 
taken off by twisting and pulling on the rough metal which rips off the 
fused skin, which deals one hit point of damage per character level to 
the bearer or 10% of the bearer’s maximum health or other equivalent

torc becomes completely infatuated with the one wearing the ring and 
instantly falls in love with them. The torc wearing creature retains 
their own personality and morals but will make every effort to please 
the other creature and will obey reasonable requests (“Never take off 
the collar unless I tell you to.” Is usually the first request given). 
The torc wearing creature will seek to protect the other from harm to 
the point of sacrificing themselves so the other can live if no other 
option is available. The creature wearing the ring experiences weakened 
but similar effects and will instantly develop a mild fondness for the 
one wearing the collar, and will not cause harm to that creature unless 
absolutely necessary. This effect ends if one of the two creatures dies,
 the torc is removed for more than one hour, the wedding ring is removed
 for more than one day or the creature wearing the ring causes 
deliberate and unnecessary harm to the torc wearing creature. A 
knowledgeable creature will discover that both of the items were created
 from a stock of hundreds of weddings rings taken from couples that had 
married young, grew old together and died while still in love. A small 
fleck from each ring was set apart and melted down in a group to create 
the wedding band, while the rest of the gold rings were melted down to 
form the torc. This object instills a forced, twisted version of the 
love those rings represented.</p>

                <td><p>Smoke Sphere: A clear glass sphere one-foot in 
diameter filled with swirling dark smoke, which fits securely into a 
simple wooden base. It is often used by student wizards for settling 
disputes involving power and might in a nonviolent manner but can also 
be used by generals and tacticians to display maps and troop movements, 
by bards to add visuals to their storytelling or by architects and 
engineers to form prototypes and display prospective models to clients. 
Some mage halls, guilds and academies have larger versions up to six 
feet in diameter in order to better facilitate challenges and duels 
between their members as well provide entertainment as a type of quasi 
sporting event. To use the Sphere a creature must make physical contact 
with the glass and concentrate on a visual image which causes the smoke 
to coalesce into that shape. The user must maintain concentration (They 
may speak if they choose) in order to keep the smoke in one form or 
change it to another shape. This allows the user to add or subtract 
features from the shape or create a moving picture or story line. The 
sphere’s magic is physically draining and each minute concentrating on 
the sphere tires the user as if it was a minute of heavy manual labor. 
Mages and other intellectuals can use this device for battles of will. 
For this purpose each user selects a form beforehand (sphere, cube, 
star, sword etc) and concentrate on forming their smoke-form while 
simultaneously preventing the other users from creating their smoke 
forms. All users must roll an initial ability or skill check (GM’s 
choice, typically intelligence, arcana, will or charisma) and an 
additional one at the end of each minute that goes by. Record the 
results separately and add them to any previous rolls to create a 
running tally for each user. In order to win, the running tally of one 
of the user’s must be at least double the total running tally of all 
other user’s combined. As the use of the sphere is physically demanding,
 the winner can also be the sole remaining user with the others having 
had their concentration broken due to exhaustion.</p>

 depicts the balance of good and evil, light and dark, good luck and bad

medallion is a physical manifestation of this balance distilled into an

 there should have been anomalies. Whenever the bearer rolls a result 
that would be considered “critical”, (Whether it is a critical success 
or critical fumble, such as a natural 1 or a 20) they instead reroll the
 result until a non-critical roll is obtained. The bearer has no control
 over this ability and cannot suppress it. During each occurrence the 
bearer feels a pulse from the medallion and senses that the situation 
could have gone better or worse. If the bearer has an increased critical

as well. The medallion must be worn for 24 continuous hours before it’s

which come together with the aid of magic to vastly improve the bearer’s
 chances to procreate healthy young. The bearer chances to become 
pregnant or to impregnate (based on the sex of the bearer) are doubled

skin contact with the pouch for 24 hours. The pouch must remain in close
 contact with the bearer and make direct contact with the user’s skin 
for at least eight non consecutive hours per 24 hour period to remain 
attuned. Females who attune the pouch while already pregnant gain the 
benefits immediately after attunement. The pouch is not limited to human

 of the flying mammals into their very bones. The bearer can tap into 
the bat’s senses by closing his eyes and spending one minute 
concentrating. The bearer then gains the echolocation abilities of a bat
 and has advantage on all hearing based perception checks and is able to
 “see” all physical objects, creatures and phenomena within a 40 foot 
radius by sound rather than sight. The bearer must keep his eyes closed 
during the time he is making use of the item (Most creature wear a 
blindfold while actively using the earrings) as the combination of the 
two types of vision is more than a the mind can bear. If while using the
 earrings the bearer opens their eyes, he takes one hit point of psychic
 damage per round due to the sensory overload until his eyes are closed 
and he is unable to benefit from the sight granted by the echolocation. 
Extremely loud noises can temporarily blind the bearer in the same way 
extremely bright lights could blind their ocular vision. Static 
background noise such as the crackling of a bonfire, a waterfall, battle

 off fleas, ticks, lice, rats, squirrels and other vermin within a 15

 pain or too sedated to care about the look of the saw. Users must be 
careful to wear chain gloves or heavily treated leather gloves in order

amputations but can also be used for incisions and delicate surgical 
work in the hands of a skilled professional. The saw grants advantage to
 medicine checks involving amputation or surgery as long as the user has
 any sort of medical training, skill or expertise. If the user lacks 
medical training it simply reduces the time required for amputations to 
seconds. This item is rarely used as a weapon since any form of real 
armor or even heavy clothing will block the Bone Saw from cutting into 
flesh and the bone itself is fairly fragile. If used as a weapon (Use 
longsword statistics dealing twice as much damage but treat it as an 
improvised weapon) whenever the wielder rolls a natural 1-5 on a hit 
with the saw, they must roll an additional 1d2. If the roll is another

sheathed for at least one hour to charge before it can be used in this 
way and the sheath can only have one weapon at any time. Knowledgeable 
PC’s will know that these items are often used by highwayman, charlatans
 and bards to fake an actual magic weapon or bluff an enemy into 
believing they have a specific type of weapon enchantment. For example, a
 “Holy” weapon can be faked with a pure high pitched tone and a bright 
white light, while an “Evil” enchantment would be the sound of a deep 
horn, dirge or pained wail accompanied by dark reds, vibrant purples, or
 sickly green colors. Occasionally lesser nobles or knights will use 
these and display their main house colors and bellow the cries of their 
house animal. The sheath is rarely used by those with the money to

 consume and digest grass for sustenance without any physical penalty. 
This item does not make the grass taste any better, nor does it ward off
 any strange looks the bearer will no doubt receive as he mows down 
mouthfuls of grass. If the collar is removed within eight hours of 
having consumed grass, the bearer instantly becomes severely nauseous as
 the vegetation still in his system becomes no longer digestible. The

crystal sphere brimming with raw divination magic that seems to reflect 
light at odd and unpredictable angles. The crystal ball is mainly used 
by creatures who feel as though they are out of options and who wish to 
brainstorm for alternate solutions. When a creature or set of creatures 
focuses their gaze into refracting sphere and concentrate on a future 
event, problem, situation or set or circumstance for one uninterrupted 
hour, they are rewarded with three visions of possible ways the event 
could come to pass and be concluded. None of the visions are fated to 
occur in any sense, nor are they even likely to occur. The visions are 
simply three different situations that could plausibly occur. These 
visions are not always resolved to the benefit of the users and the 
visions are usually divided into a “safe” option that is unlikely end 
fatally for the users but may not actually succeed, a second vision with
 moderate risk and moderate successful conditions and a high risk vision
 that ends with the accomplished goals but considerable losses. Despite 
the lack of magically guaranteed outcome the three visions are 
invaluable for those who who have no ideas of their own, as the object 
rarely provides a course of action that the user has already considered.
 Therefore the ball may not function properly if the user have already 
voiced or considered a large number of solutions and may only show one 
or two vision or even none at all. The crystal ball may be used once per
 week and may be used by up to five creatures at once. —Note: This 
object is meant for the DM to provide options of alternate plans for 
their players who may be stuck in game and unaware how to solve a plot 
point, how to advance the story or get past an obstacle. It’s 
recommended to give players vague hints on what they could do rather 
than tell them exactly what they should do. If the solution is how to 
get into a barricaded wooden fort in order to rescue a captured princess
 the three visions could be described as: 1, “You gather a number of 
ranged weapons, ammunition and supplies and lay siege to the fort. 
Months pass while you remain bored yet unharmed, they eventually 
negotiate with you but in the meantime the princess becomes quite ill 
due to malnutrition and is barely alive when she is finally turned over 
to you” 2, “You find a blind spot on the fort’s wall and sneak over in 
it in the dead of night. You locate the princess and are discovered by 
several guards, subduing or killing many of them while taking many blows
 yourself before securing the princess.” 3, “You find a hard to reach 
area in the back of the wooden fort and drench it in oil and set it 
ablaze during the night. While the guards are distracted you scale a 
wall and kill several in a bucket line. You secure the princess but you 
both suffer serious injuries between the combat and the raging fires.” 
Alternatively you can present three options of badly ending visions that
 you know as a DM will not succeed perhaps ruling out some of the 
party’s poorer options.</p>

 brimming with divine prophetic energy, that imparts an adherent the 
ability to see the future through their God’s eyes. The symbol is mainly
 used by creatures who feel as though they are out of options and who 
wish to call upon their God in search of answers. It is also used by 
believers who have ventured out on their own and who wish to be able to 
consult their god as to the appropriate course of action based on the 
tenets of their faith. When a creature or set of creatures earnestly 
pray over the sacred object for one uninterrupted hour while 
concentrating on a future event, problem, situation or set or 
circumstances, they are rewarded with two visions of possible ways the 
event could come to pass and be concluded. Neither of the visions are 
fated to occur in any sense, nor are they even likely to occur. The 
visions are simply two different situations that could plausibly occur. 
These visions are not always resolved to the benefit of the users and 
the visions are usually divided into a course of action that upholds and
 makes use of the God’s domains and tenets ending in a positive outcome 
and a second vision that goes completely against the beliefs of the 
God’s domain, ending in a negative outcome. It is not unheard of however
 to receive visions of two different positive outcomes upholding the 
faith or two different negative outcomes betraying the tenets of the 
God’s domain. Despite the lack of divinely guaranteed outcome, the two 
visions are invaluable for those who who have no ideas of their own, as 
the symbol rarely provides a course of action that the user has already 
considered. Therefore the symbol may not function properly if the user 
have already voiced or considered a large number of solutions and may 
simply grant visions of solutions he has already contemplated. Should 
the situation be far removed from the God’s domain and experience it is 
possible that the vision offer so solid solution or one that includes 
leaving the situation entirely. A God of Nature would have little to 
offer on how to resolve complex political maneuverings between three 
rival countries and may offer visions of animal fighting to establish 
territory or marking said territory through urination or claw markings. 
The holy symbol may be used once per day and may be used by up to five 
creatures at once. —Note: This object is meant for the DM to provide

and unaware how to solve a plot point, how to advance the story or get

 Knowledgeable might grants visions instructing the users to gather more
 information on the problem and make a more informed decision, while 
Gods of Slaughter would advocate killing the problem and everything that
 stands in the way of killing the problem.</p>

 already have a sense of sight for the binding’s magic to function,
