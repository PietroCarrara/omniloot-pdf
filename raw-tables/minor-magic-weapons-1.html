    <div class="description">
        <h4 class="heading">Description (more info)</h4>
        <div> 
            <p>The first magic weapon a character receives in a video 
game, roleplaying game or a novel is rarely the strongest weapon they 
will come across. As the story progresses they may leave their original 
weapon behind as they move on to stronger enchantments and true 
artifacts of world ending power. Or they may find that their weapon’s 
strength is directly proportional to their own and that as they become 
the hero they were meant to be, their weapon becomes a conduit of that 
potential. Video games in particular have little issue handing out 
breadcrumbs of increasingly powerful magic weapons to allow the player 
to keep up with increasingly difficult enemies and satisfying their 
looting needs. In many RPG settings however there are few mechanical 
ways to make a weapon stronger than normal but weaker than a standard +1
 enchantment. Oftentimes these settings will be plentiful in rich 
descriptions of end game artifact weapons with epic tier abilities, 
while having no lower level unique weapons whatsoever. As the majority 
of campaigns start and take place mostly in the lower levels it means 
that players read about and yearn for these interesting weapons they 
will likely never use. To combat this I’ve drawn on inspiration from 
hundreds of sources to develop a collection of Unique Minor Magic 
Weapons that are scaled down versions of their stronger counterparts. In
 game they can appear as cheap imitations, homages or legacy weapons 
gain in strength with their wielder. These are essentially artifact 
weapons for level 1 characters with all of the charm, mystery and flair 
of their epic level counterparts. They have drawbacks, limitations and 
can relay on the strength of their wielder but can provide the extra 
little bump to turn a TPK into a collective near death experience. These
 unique weapons allow a DM to easily provide a weak but flavorful 
addition to their world.</p>

functional) battleaxe with a blade shaped like a crescent moon, similar 
to that of a monk’s spade. The symbol of a roaring lion is etched onto 
the grip of the weapon and the wielder can feel the power and warmth of 
the sun tingle over their entire body. The battleaxe features two golden
 protrusions, one larger than the other, with the white tips of a spear,
 the longer one is in the middle at the top of the weapon and the 
smaller one is on the opposite of the blade of the axe. The handle is 
dark blue and it features a golden semicircular guard with four golden 
outward facing spikes on it. The weapon is treated as a +1 in direct 
sunlight and the wielder can see look directly into the brightness of 
the sun without suffering any sort of discomfort or damage whatsoever. 
The weapon must have received at least one hour total of direct sunlight
 in the past 24 hours for its magic to function.—Note: Direct sunlight 
can include shady areas such as under a forest canopy but not areas 
primarily lit but non sunlight such as most indoor settings.</p>

etched with vines, clouds, and wave’s motifs, set with sapphires and 
emeralds. The hilts appear to be wrapped in twine and when both are held
 they seem to feel as if that were vibrating slightly. When used as a 
pair in combat, their spellbound natures seem to resonate with each 
other, empowering both blades. When dual wielded, dozens of thin, barely
 visible strands of ethereal power flow from one blade to the other in 
an overlapping web as if the knives were playing cat’s cradle with each 
other. While fighting with both weapons, the wielder can react 
instinctively to cause the strands of weightless, insubstantial energy 
to form into a solid spiderweb of force for a moment of time. This 
barrier of arcane might serves as a functional, (If briefly lived) 
defense allowing the wielder a moment of respite against most attacks. 
Using an action equivalent to an attack of opportunity (See Note) the 
wielder may attempt to block an incoming melee or ranged weapon attack, 
increasing his armor class or physical defensiveness as if he was 
properly wielding a shield (Typically a +2). —Note: If your system 
doesn’t use attacks of opportunity use the following rule: Once the 
wielder attempts to block an attack he is no longer able to do so until 
the start of his next turn.</p>

long metal chain ending in a heavy mace’s head on the end (Which deals 
bludgeoning damage), yet is no harder to wield than an ordinary whip. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize the house symbol of the Belmont clan 
etched on the grip of the weapon. House Belmont has stood against 
vampires and the forces of darkness for generations and the impulse to 
wage war against evil is bred into their bones. When used in combat by a
 good creature, the whip functions as a +1 against demons and undead. 
Whenever a demon or undead creature is killed by the whip, their body 
explodes from the divine power of the weapon, dealing radiant damage 
equivalent to a dagger to all demons and undead within five feet of the 
exploding creature. The whip can sense the true nature of its wielder, 
rejecting those who have sinned its eyes. A creature who has ever 
summoned or made a deal with a devil or raised, summoned or commanded an
 undead creature is never considered proficient with the whip.</p>

statistics) adorned on both ends with a single golden ring and decorated
 along the body with astronomical charts and an inscription towards one 
tip listing the weapon’s name. The weapon is surprisingly heavy for its 
looks, as if it is actually far more that it seems. The bearer of the 
golden hooped staff can mentally command it to change size, causing it 
to become as long as a pike or as small as a needle. The weapon’s weight
 is proportional to its form and when needle sized, it can be 
comfortably carried behind an ear or tucked in the bearer’s hair while 
traveling. While lengthened to a pike, the weapon still functions as a 
quarterstaff but adds five feet to the wielder’s reach for the purposes 
of attacking. Changing the size of the weapon is an action equivalent to
 drawing a weapon.</p>

                <td><p>Bolter: A large, heavy steel shield covered in 
nearly two dozen spikes making it ideal for bashing enemies and keeping 
them at bay in addition to the typical protection of a shield. A 
perceptive PC will notice that the spikes are actually crossbow bolts 
pointing outward, whose bases are somehow seamlessly sunk into the 
shield. The wielder can raise the spiked shield and utter the command 
word (Using an action equivalent to an attack or casting a spell), to 
activate its magic, causing all the bolts to launch outwards in a 
barrage of steel. The bearer makes one attack roll as if he had fired a 
light crossbow and all creatures in a 15 foot cone from where the bearer
 is facing are pelted with the bolts. The attack is compared to their 
Armor Class (Or Defense Value, Dodge or other relevant game statistic), 
then the wielder then rolls one damage roll as normal for a light 
crossbow and each creature hit takes that damage. After being activated 
Bolter is treated as a standard shield until the bolts are replaced at 
which time it can be used as a spiked shield again. A bearer can replace
 the spikes during a one hour ritual (Which is etched into the back of 
the armor) in which he slowly sinks 20 crossbow bolts into the shields 
face. The wielder can sink specialized bolts (Such as silvered, poisoned
 or +1 bolts.) into the shield to increase its effectiveness, but all 20
 bolts much be of the same type or there is no special effect. Bolts 
launched in this way are destroyed after use and are not recoverable.</p>

bone of a murderous necromancer, this vile tool now works as a 
inquisitor’s compass. If the weapon is placed on a flat surface it will 
point to the closest undead within 100 feet. If there are multiple 
undead in different locations the knife will simply spin in a constant 
circle. The weapon is treated as a +1 against undead creatures.</p>

wire adorned with skulls carved of ruby that shriek when thrown. A 
creature restrained by the net has disadvantage on any checks or saves 
to resist fear effects. A creature who is under the influence of a fear 
effect has disadvantage on all attempts to break free or escape the iron
 net. The metal wires are five times are difficult to cut through as a 
typical weighted net (Five times as many hit points for example) and if 
cut, the net repairs itself over the course of an hour if wrapped around
 the fresh corpse (Less than 12 hours dead) of a humanoid who died while
 frightened.</p>

                <td><p>Dwarven Battle Stein: A large heavily battered 
steel tankard that has been mounted to a metal rod and can be used as a 
weapon. The stein features a number of wicked flanges and despite its 
odd design, functions effectively as a one-handed mace.  Alcoholic 
liquids placed in the tankard never spill and the vessel can hold up to 
one liter when full. If the mace successfully strikes a target while the
 stein contains alcohol, the wielder may choose to active the weapon’s 
unique magic. Upon activation, the stein magically empties and both the 
wielder and the target are treated as if they had each drank half of the
 stein’s contents. Both creatures are only affected by the stein’s 
alcohol content and not by other poisons, toxins or allergens the 
beverage may contain. The stein must be refilled between each activation
 which typically takes two hands and an action equivalent to making an 
attack or casting a spell.</p>

                <td><p>Truncheon of the Night Watchman: A well made one 
handed bludgeon (Club statistics) made from polished oak with the phrase
 “Who Watches the Watchmen?” carved just above the grip. This weapon 
(Whether it’s called a billy club, truncheon or baton) is the iconic 
weapon of guards and watchmen, embodying the spirit of those who prowl 
the night, protecting those who sleep the sleep of the just. A creature 
worthy of wielding the weapon gains boons to aid them enforce the law in
 the dark of night. The wielder gains greatly improved low light vision 
and can see in dim light within 30 feet of himself as if it was bright 
light and is able to distinguish color and detail under these 
conditions. Night watchman work long hours during the night and often 
need to sacrifice sleep during the day to maintain a social life. 
Eventually the lack of sleep becomes a normal routine and the wielder 
requires one less hour of sleep per day to be considered fully rested. 
The Truncheon grants powers and abilities to the wielder at a cost, as 
those who enforce the law must be always be held to a higher standard. 
The bearer can carry, but not wield any other weapons with the exception
 of a quarterstaff, another club, or a single dagger. Furthermore, 
anytime the wielder would deal a killing blow to a humanoid, the target 
must instead be rendered unconscious but stable. Lastly, the wielder may
 not knowingly and purposely violate any local laws set in place by a 
legitimate authority which have punishments greater than a warning or a 
monetary fine. The wielder must have the Truncheon in his possession and
 meeting its requirements for 48 hours before it’s magical effects start
 to take effect —Note: At the DM’s discretion other weapons (Such as 
weighted nets, short swords, bolas, crossbows or other weapons commonly 
carried by local guards) can be wielded while still making use of the 
truncheon’s powers.</p>

                <td><p>Bystander’s Bane: A fist sized, sealed glass orb 
filled with black and white liquids in a yin-yang design which are kept 
separate by a thick layer of glass. A knowledgeable PC can identify the 
liquids as holy and unholy water, essentially the distilled essence of 
good and evil separated by simple glass. The orb can be thrown as a 
ranged weapon which shatters on impact, showering a single creature in 
broken glass (Dealing as much damage as a dagger) and splashing the 
target with both liquids. The holy and unholy water mix together and 
deals damage to those who have refused or refrained from taking a moral 
side. An intelligent, neutral creature (A creature who is not overly 
good or evil, regardless if they are lawful or chaotic) is damaged by 
the mixture of holy and unholy water even if they would not normally be 
hurt by either of them. The mixture of the two divine liquids causes 
more harm to the target than either of them on their own and a neutral 
target is takes damage equal to the equivalent of three doses of holy or
 unholy water (See Note), half of which is considered radiant while the 
other half necrotic damage, plus the piecing damage from the broken 
glass. The holy water burns the target with white fire, putting off 
billowing clouds of pure steam, while the unholy water melts the target 
with black acid putting off trails of thick acrid smoke which curl 
downward. If the creature is morally good or evil (Or is incapable of 
making conscious moral choice such as a construct, animal or mindless 
creature) the orb shatters dealing damage from the glass but the liquids
 manage to counter each other rather than finding a mutual target.  
—Note: In games with no strict alignment or moral code, the DM has final
 say on what creatures are valid targets for this object. In such games,
 the orb automatically impart to its wielder which creatures within 30 
feet are moral bystanders and thus valid targets so the weapon is not 
wasted. If there are no stats for holy or unholy water damage in your 
game, substitute the equivalent damage of three flasks of acid or three 
Molotov cocktails.</p>

suited for the brutally efficient style of pragmatic fighting used by 
seasoned mercenaries and veteran soldiers. The metal is made entirely of
 a slate grey steel with a rough boarhide grip. Extremely perceptive 
PC’s will notice that the oval shaped pommel is actually a sling bullet 
held in place by a quartet of metal prongs at the base of the hilt as 
though it was a gemstone in a ring. The bastard sword is able to fire 
the bullet in tandem with a successful attack in order to deliver a low 
blow to the target. This underhanded technique is dirty fighting at is 
finest, though none can deny its effectiveness. Once per day when the 
wielder successfully attacks a target, he may fire the piece of lead 
ammunition directly into the victim’s crotch or rough equivalent of one.
 This is treated as an automatic hit and deals damage as though the 
wielder had launched it from a sling as a typical attack. Furthermore if
 the target is a humanoid, the sneaky shot hits a critical area and the 
victim’s speed is halved until the start of the wielder’s next turn. 
Once fired the setting remains empty until the bearer places a single 
nonmagical sling bullet on of the empty setting, which causes the 
ammunition to merge seamlessly into the sword, becoming the pommel.</p>

 bearer can sense that although the weapon is lethal in its own right, 
its true power can only be obtained by physically bonding with it. The 
wielder can activate the weapon’s magic with a thought during his turn, 
taking an action equivalent to attacking or casting a spell. When 
activated, the weapon’s dried wicker handle springs to life and 
instantly grows a swarm of roots that burrow into the wielder’s hand. 
The creature feels an unpleasant amount of pressure but no actual pain 
and takes no damage as the roots penetrate the skin, forcing it to 
remain grasped to the handle. Afterwards, the whip feels as if it was a 
natural extension the wielder’s arm, making him proficient in the 
weapon’s use if he was not already. The whip is treated as a +1 while 
bound to the wielder in this way. While rooted to the wielder’s hand, 
the whip cannot be released or disarmed and the wielder cannot use that 
hand for tasks requiring any sort of manual dexterity as the hand is 
considered actively wielding the weapon at all times. To sever the bond 
to the whip, the wielder can spend two full minutes carefully slicing 
away the roots where they enter the skin, suffering two hit points of 
damage per character level (Or 20% of his maximum health or other 
equivalent amount), or he can take an action equivalent to attacking or 
casting a spell and use a free hand to rip it off by force, dealing 
twice that amount of damage to himself due to the sheer amount of lost 
skin and tissue.</p>

 weapon still smells strongly of fresh timber and the forest. After a 
few minutes of handling, the wielder’s hands become covered in sticky 
tree sap that seems to perpetually leak from the weapon but never 
completely covers it or dries up. The small stick of the world tree’s 
greatness is empowered by being bathed in the life’s blood of a mortal 
being and bestows a minor blessing to the wielder who provides it such a
 sacrifice. The blood coating the spearhead turns to tree sap and flows 
up along the wielder’s arms and body, quickly hardening into a 
protective layer of bark. This second skin absorbs some of the pains and
 wounds of battle before falling apart. Whenever the wielder lands a 
killing blow against a living creature, the wielder gains a number of 
temporary hit points equal to two hit points per character (Or 20% of 
maximum health or other equivalent amount), represented by the 
protective bark-skin. Whenever the wielder would take damage, the bark 
absorbs it instead, shielding the wielder from harm. If this damage 
reduces the temporary hit points to zero, the wielder takes any 
remaining damage. The bark sheds off of his skin when the amount 
temporary hit points reaches zero or until one minute passes. If the 
wielder kills a creature while the effect is still active, the amount of
 temporary hit points and timer is reset, it does not stack with itself.
 For this ability to function, the dying creature’s maximum hit points 
must be at least as much as the protective second skin would create, 
otherwise the spear doesn’t consider it a proper sacrifice and nothing 
happens.</p>

Knowledgeable PCs will remember stories of this weapon being forged and 
wielded by a man cursed by a witch with a craving for murder. The 
stories vary on exact reason the she cursed him, but the witch’s spell 
was more powerful than she anticipated, leaving her victim with an 
eternal curse of unstoppable rage. Murdering a living creature replaced 
his need of food, water and sleep, nor would he age as long as he kept 
killing. The curse’s magic seeped into his flesh and bones warping him 
into a creature of magic and he crafted this sword from the iron of the 
blood of a tiny fraction of those he had killed. When held, the bearer 
yearns for the immediate death of living things in his presence (But is 
not outright compelled to kill) and desires to spill blood at all times.
 If the wielder grasps the sword in both hands, closes his eyes and 
concentrates on these feelings (Spending an action equivalent to 
attacking or casting a spell) he becomes aware of the directions of all 
living creatures within 100 feet that are below their full hit point 
total. The weapon then begins to tug in the direction of the freshly 
spilled blood, trying to take the wielder to the fight they crave. 
Whenever the wielder lands a killing blow on a humanoid creature, the 
wielder requires one less hour of sleep the next time he rests (Stacking
 with itself to a minimum of one hour of sleep), requires one less meal 
that day (Stacking with itself to a minimum of one meal) and he does not
 age for the next hour.</p>

blacksmith’s tool glows red hot, instantly reforging itself into a 
warhammer (Taking no action and dealing no damage to the wielder) and 
causes the bearer to speak in a ringing, metallic voice. The wielder’s 
attacks become powerful and unfalteringly like those of a seasoned 
blacksmith, capable of hammering relentlessly from dawn to dusk. Instead
 of a single damage die when the wielder successfully hits a target (See
 Note), the player instead rolls two dice that equal the value of the 
original damage die and add the results together. The warhammer returns 
to its tool form once the weapon is released. The bearer gains an almost
 instinctual insight over metalwork and is blessed with the memories of 
serious blacksmithing failures the previous wielders experienced using 
the hammer and how they’ve learned, grown and started anew. Whenever the
 bearer uses hammer as a tool while making a blacksmithing (Or general 
metalwork) craft check and would roll a natural 1, he becomes aware of 
the mistakes as he creates them and can start over instead of critically
 failing the task. The bearer can instead can either attempt the craft 
check again from the beginning or stop entirely and try later. The 
bearer still loses any time invested into the first check (Which can be 
days or weeks for larger projects), but is able to salvage all of the 
material components so that they can be used for the subsequent attempt.
 The Goddess expects worship from and loyalty from her followers and the
 hammer’s magic only functions for bearers who have prayed to Her in 
earnest for at least one hour within the last 24 hours. —Note: For 
example, if a normal warhammer deals 1d8 damage wielded in one hand and 
1d10 in two hands, The Symbol of the Forge deals 2d4 and 1d4+1d6

vibrations which are transmitted into the attacker’s weapon. These 
vibrations make it difficult for opponents to maintain their grip and 
the wielder gains advantage on checks (Or the target has disadvantage, 
whichever is better for the wielder) made to disarm an enemy while using
 the sword. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit, he may choose to
 forgo the additional damage granted by the natural 20 to instead use 
the sword to disarm the target, which causes one object of the wielder’s
 choice that the target is holding to drop to its feet. The blade’s 
unique shape allows it to cut the victims’ internal flesh into small 
shreds and whenever the player roll a 1 on a die to calculate the 
weapon’s damage, they can reroll the die until they receives a result 
that is not a 1 (See Note). These wounds are difficult to heal and in 
grim cases, the victim may suffer infection and die a terrible death 
even if they survive the initial wounding. The sinuous flamberge is 
feared as a weapon of anguish and those of goodwill may refrain from its
 use. The wielder must have practiced with the sword for at least one 
hour in the past week in order to remain accustomed to the vibrations 
and be considered proficient with it. —Note: This only affects the

bonuses. The needle-like blade can easily penetrate most mail or find 
its way through gaps in plate armor and is narrow enough to smoothly 
pass through the eye slits of the helmeted knight. A severely wounded 
opponent, who is not expected to survive, can be given a “mercy strike” 
using the blade. Even unscrupulous mercenaries have a semblance of 
battlefield honor and many would choose to mete out (And receive in

completely covered in carvings of the names of noble Minotaurs who fell 
honorably in battle defending the safety of their tribe. Where the 
wielder’s hands would naturally hold the weapon are two names larger 
than any other that are slightly raised up from the wood rather that 
carved into it. A wielder who grips the halberd tightly can feel the 
names “Seoris Toughstep” and “Kuope Stormroar” press against the flesh 
of his hands. The weapon’s notched head reminds an observer why the 
halberd is called a ‘poleaxe’ as the blade seemed to be little more than
 a slightly modified battleaxe blade, expertly mounted to the shaft. 
Resting behind the worn blade lies a weathered Minotaur horn that serves
 as the top spike whose point curves slightly forward over the blade, 
always towards the enemy. The majority of the horn is stained with 
various layers of dark polish, soot and old murky blood making it pitch 
black in color. Etched into the base of the horn lies the name “Crete 
Blackhorn”. The wielder always feels a touch homesick for the lands of 
his ancestors and the advice, traditions and wisdom of relatives long 
since passed away. Despite the longings of the past, the wielder is 
comforted by the knowledge that his forbearers are watching over him and
 that regardless of where he wanders, he never truly walks alone. The 
weapon is considered a +1 when wielded by Minotaurs. Once per day, the 
bearer can spend a few moments in quiet concentration to let the 
guidance of his ancestors flow through him, granting advantage to any 
skill or ability check regarding knowledge, history or memory.  </p>

The body and head of the crossbow has been forged in the visage of an 
Infernal Dragon with four large horn-like spines sweeping back from its 
brow and temporal ridges. Each time the weapon fires, the dragon’s maw 
releases a belch of flame and smoke along with the launch of a slightly 
molten crossbow bolt that splashes its target in liquid iron. Half of 
the damage dealt by the weapon is considered fire damage while the rest 
is normal for its type. Twice per day, the wielder can whisper a curse 
in infernal while firing the crossbow, causing the dragon’s head to 
discharge a larger cloud of billowing smoke that fills the five foot 
square in front of the wielder with dense black mist. A creature within 
the cloud becomes engulfed in the opaque smoke and he is effectively 
blinded but also gains full cover from outside attacks. The dark fog is 
harmless, causing no injury and dissipating completely at the start of

gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of Yan-C-Bin, the 
archomental Prince of Evil Air and the tiny fragment of his essence 
influences the bearer, encouraging him to act in a mercurial and 
unreliable fashion. A long term bearer may discover his personality 
changing, finding that he is more likely to break his vows and plans and
 that duty and honor mean nothing to him. The bearer is never forced to 
act on these feelings but so long as he carries the weapon he may be 
swayed by its influence. The spear is not without benefit however and 
the shred of the prince’s pure elemental power trapped within it carries
 the chance to spawn more of its kind. Whenever the wielder scores a 
critical hit with Windvane, the very air is impregnated with life and 
the primal energy gives birth to a miniature tornado. The newborn 
whirlwind considers the wielder its lord and attacks the last creature 
to have harmed the wielder. Sadly, the elemental’s form is unstable and 
it dies after one minute if not slain first. —Note: The elemental acts 
on the turn immediately after the wielder and the DM can use wolf 
statistics for the elemental’s equivalent statistics for hit points, 
attacks, size, etc if no better option is available. At higher levels of
 play, the statistics of a larger elemental or dire wolf can be used to 
keep this weapon relevant.</p>

devil with ruby eyes, and a broad open mouth, wide enough for a gold 
coin. If the bearer should place a gold coin into the devil’s mouth 
(Taking an action equivalent to making an attack or casting a spell), 
the fiend’s jaw closes, sealing the pact and causing the weapon to be 
treated as a +1 for the next five minutes. There is no limit to the 
number of coins the devil can be fed over the course of a day and each 
coin placed in the fiend’s mouth disappears and is not recoverable. 
Knowledgeable PC’s will recognize the species of fiend as one that 
serves the arch-devil of greed and avarice; Mammon. Those PC’s will know
 that the sword seems to be a straightforward, if simple contract 
between the wielder and Mammon of money in return for power. —Note: If 
one single gold piece seems too low, the DM can rule that the mouth can 
fit five or ten gold pieces or a single platinum piece worth X gold. A 
DM could rule that any item of value could be placed within the mouth in
 a pinch. The bearer might have to sacrifice a large pearl worth 100

 was forged, without heat, by a master of arcane craftsmanship. As the

weapon may either have five times as many hit points or have a greatly 
increased hardness or damage reducing quality. If there is no existing 
system in place and weapons simply break or do not break as a result of

rage of the thing bound within, and to master Gore Thirster they must 
overcome a fearsome will focused upon murder and destruction. The demon 
bound within is never satisfied with the bare minimum of pain and 
suffering and whenever the player roll a 1 on a die to calculate the 
weapon’s damage, they must reroll the die until they receives a result 
that is not a 1 (See Note). The wielder can never use Gore Thirster to 
inflict non lethal / stun damage and if the wielder deals enough damage 
to be given the choice to render a target unconscious or kill them, they
 must choose to kill the enemy. The fiend sparks a fiery bloodlust in 
the wielder but a creature who is already capable of inciting a primal 
frenzy in themselves, finds their battle prowess demonically magnified. A
 wielder who is raging, frenzied, rampaging or under a similar status 
effect treats the weapon as a +1. Gore Thirster allows itself to be 
wielder by neutral and good mortals as well as evil ones, in the hopes 
of corrupting and collecting souls for its archdemon master, however it 
never allows itself to be wielded by ordained mortals who serve Gods of 
grace or moral ambiguity. Non-evil creatures who are capable of casting 
divine magics (Such as clerics, paladins or most druids) are never 
considered proficient with Gore Thirster and take one point of psychic 
damage from the demon’s spite fueled hate whenever they make and attack 
with the weapon. —Note: Rerolling the damage only affects the weapon’s 
damage die itself and not other sources of additional damage such as 
sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects.</p>

looks like it has seen more than its fair share of death and has been 
carried into battle by countless unknown soldiers. The emblem of a 
well-known mercenary company is etched on the grip of the weapon. Over 
its long history of near constant use, the weapon has taken on a small 
measure of the shared feelings of bitterness and cynicism of its many 
wielders. The bearer develops a sense of gallows humor over the prospect
 of death and is able to accept the idea of a grim and violent end with a
 final laugh and spit in the eye of whatever devil has a claim on their 
soul. The bearer will still fight to the bitter end against hopeless 
odds to save their own life or that of an ally but the wielder knows 
that with his last breath he will great death as an old friend and 
finally be able to rest from the aches and scars of countless battle 
that line their skin and haunt their dreams. If a creature is dealt a 
killing blow from this weapon, their body does not rot or decay in any 
way for seven days and during this time the body cannot be made into an 
undead. The effect also extends the time limit on raising the target 
from the dead and days spent under the influence of the weapon’s effect 
don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead. Should a
 creature be killed while actively wielding the weapon, their body is 
also affected in the same manner. Knowledgeable PC’s will have heard 
stories of mercenaries companies who give weapons such as these to 
soldiers who man the back lines (Typically green troops that are still 
in training, veterans who are too old or infirm for direct combat and 
the walking wounded who may be close to death themselves) and patrol the
 battlefield dealing final killing blows to the mortally wounded. A 
simple thrust of the sharp spear through the neck, eye or heart will 
allow the downed combatant to die quickly, sparing further anguish 
without even requiring the wielder to bend over. A soldier’s mercy of a 
quick end compared to hours or days of agony dying slowly to gut wound 
or a gangrenous lesion. This added enchantment allowed the fallen of the
 mercenary company to be taken care of without risk of infection or 
disease relating to rotting corpses and prevented their enemies from 
raising any of the dispatched soldiers as undead to be used against 
them. Some of the more unscrupulous companies were even known to ransom 
the preserved corpses of higher ranking soldiers or dead nobles to the 
highest bidder.</p>

valuable, yet weak metal is normally not well suited for combat purposes
 but through the combination of alchemical treatments and magical 
enchantments, the gold is stronger and more durable than steel. A 
wielder can spend an action equivalent to drawing a weapon to flex their
 hand, to open one of the rigid gauntlets or close one into a fist. 
While opened they functions as typical gauntlets able to grab, wield and
 hold objects and clenching them into closed fists activates their 
greedy magical enchantments. When closed, a gauntlet deals damage 
equivalent to a club (Both gauntlets can be used at once using two 
weapon fighting rules as normal) and when the wielder lands a critical 
hit, instead of producing blood, ichor or other similar substance, the 
target bleeds pure gold droplets. The equivalent of one gold coin per 
point of hit point damage dealt by the attack, tumbles out of the 
target’s body and falls to the ground. If the critical hit results in 
the death of the creature, a substantial amount of the victim’s body 
turns to gold and the amount of gold that would be created by that 
attack doubles. —Note: DM’s can change the effect to function on the 
first time per day the wielder lands a critical hit if they feel their 
players will get distracted trying to abuse the effect to get rich

 weapon is immediately absorbed into itself, leaving no trace. The sword
 possesses a monstrous thirst for blood and gore that can never be fully
 sated but can be temporarily quenched. The scimitar passes along this 
bloodlust to the wielder who never craves blood for himself but is given
 the understanding that providing the blade with what it desires will 
increase its power. Knowledgeable PC’s know that according to some, the 
scimitar was the first murder weapon in history, (This is likely untrue 
and probably stems from the fact that its name translates from elvish to
 “bloody murder”) while according to others, it was the phylactery of a 
powerful vampiric lich long forgotten by time. Parasitic in nature, the 
blade grows exponentially more powerful the more blood it absorbs. It 
can “drink” the blood of its victims in small amounts by merely wounding
 them, but those who wish to truly unlock its potential often leave the 
blade embedded in a corpse overnight. If the weapon is plunged into a 
freshly deceased creature (See Note) and remains there for at least one 
uninterrupted hour, it is treated as a +1 for eight hours after being 
withdrawn from the body. During this time the weapon draws all the blood
 and general moisture from the corpse leaving it a desiccated husk when 
it is withdrawn. If the scimitar is left in the corpse for a period of a
 least eight uninterrupted hours, it is treated as a +1 for 24 hours 
after being withdrawn and reduces the corpse to a pile of dust.  —Note: 
The creature should be no more than 12 hours dead, be the size of a wolf
 or larger and have possessed a blood based circulatory system while 
alive. The DM’s has discretion on what corpses qualify to feed the

profane necromantic glyphs. The weapon seems to twitch like a divining 
rod when near a fresh corpse, the tip of the blade seeming to want to 
bury itself in the body’s entrails. In addition to being a functional 
dagger, the weapon is a tool of the bloody art of anthropomancy, a 
method of divination by the entrails of dead or dying creatures. The 
blade grants its wielder the knowledge and craft of the art that 
normally takes a lifetime to learn. The wielder gains the ability to use
 the dagger to quickly cut into a corpse that has been dead for a minute
 or less and excise the liver in an action equivalent to making an 
attack or casting a spell. Once removed, the wielder can begin a one 
minute ritual that consists of scrutinizing the organ for signs of omens
 and portents while considering a specific course of action (The player 
must disclose this idea to the DM) that the wielder plans to take within
 the next eight hours. After the wielder examines the liver he is able 
to determine through visceral divination whether the course of action 
will likely provide Good, Bad or Mixed results based on the omens (This 
answer is provided to the player by the DM). If the specified course of 
action is too vague, would end in mixed results or results that aren’t 
especially good or bad the wielder reads the omens as Mixed. 
Furthermore, there is a 20% chance that the ritual fails to function at 
all and provides Mixed omens. The wielder has no way of confirming if 
the ritual functioned correctly or gave him a Mixed result based on 
vague information, lack of meaningful outcomes either way or simply 
failing to divine properly. However, should the wielder use the liver of
 a humanoid creature for the divining ritual, the 20% chance of the 
ritual failing falls to zero and the wielder is always provided with 
accurate results. —Note: The Good or Bad results only concern the 
wielder, therefore if the course of action would lead to an ally losing a
 hand but the wielder gaining 100 gold the omens would be Good.</p>

noble last stands and famous martyrs. The grip of the weapon is covered 
with razor sharp, metallic needles each finer than baby’s hair. These 
barbs sink into the wielder’s hand causing pain but causing no actual 
damage or leaving any marks in the skin. The pain imparts to the wielder
 that life is pain, but that his specific pain and death may serve as a 
temporary shield for others so that they may live in peace. The wielder 
is imparted with the idea that his life comes second to the lives of 
others that he is protecting. To that end, the sword allows the wielder a
 way to channel a fraction of his life essence through the weapon which 
magnifies it to damage the target. A dead enemy is no longer a threat 
and the health sacrificed is often less than being struck by a simple 
dagger, making it a good trade. After successfully attacking the target 
but before rolling damage, the wielder may choose to sacrifice up to one
 hit point per character level (Or 10% of maximum health or other 
equivalent amount) in order to deal additional damage equal to twice the
 amount sacrificed to the target. Alternatively, once per month after a 
successful attack, the wielder can choose to sacrifice all of their 
current hit points (Leaving themselves at 0 and making death saving 
throws) in order to deal additional damage equal to twice the amount 
sacrificed to the target. For 24 hours after sacrificing all of their 
hit points in this way the wielder is only healed for the minimum number
 of rolled hit points (See Note) whenever they receive healing from any 
source. In both cases, the additional damage is considered the same type
 as the weapon’s attack and is added together with the rolled damage. 
The sacrificed hit points cannot be reduced in any way but the wielder’s
 hit point total is not effected. —Note: For example; A party member 
cast a healing spell on the dying martyred wielder that normally heals 
for 1d8+4. The wielder would only regain 5 hit points because the d8 is 
considered to have rolled a 1. A healing potion administered to the 
martyred wielder that restores 2d4+4 hit points would restore 6 hit 
points, until the 24 hours passes.</p>

differed woods glued together, its looks are enhanced by being painted 
in complex patterns of green, replicating foliage. The ribs and contours
 of the painted leaves are contoured with inlaid silver, and seem to 
glow as if reflecting the light of the moon. The string is made from 
unicorn hair. The arrows shot from these bows have an unerring tendency 
to strike at the weakest parts of the armor, and seem to always seek the
 heart or other vital organs. These bows are the badge of office of the 
sentinels that patrol the borders of the elven woods, and their 
possession by non-elves is looked as proof of murder of a sentinel, 
since they’re almost never sold to outsiders. The weapon is treated as a
 +1 when wielded by an elf.</p>

proficient wielder can choose to wield it as a shortsword or dagger) 
with an imprint of a leaping wolf on the side of its worn, deer leather 
grip. A bearer feels a sense of animalistic cunning from the weapon and 
that despite its simple appearance, it is much more than it seems. After
 three days in the possession of a bearer who has never deliberately 
harmed or killed a wolf, the bearer’s eyes become a bright yellow even 
golden color, glow faintly in the dark and catch the light, granting a 
wolfish appearance. This effect fades 24 hours after the knife has left 
the wielder’s possession. A wolf eyed wielder takes on some of the 
heightened senses of the untamed wolf and can see in low or dim light as
 if it was bright light and gains advantage to any perception checks 
made regarding their sense of smell. Wolves are pack hunters and a 
golden eyed bearer instinctually benefits from a nearby ally while in 
combat, using the minor distraction to go for the enemy’s throat. The 
wielder gains a +1 on damage rolls with the weapon if an allied creature
 is within five feet of the target. Bearers who have ever harmed or 
killed wolves feel a strong sense of betrayal and revulsion when 
touching the knife and they cannot benefit from its magic nor are they 
considered proficient with the weapon.</p>

words “The House Always Wins.” carved into the wood just above the grip 
and a pair of dice etched into the grip itself. The wielder feels as if 
each time they swing the weapon in lethal combat they’re actually 
rolling a set of dice with their life resting on the outcome. Gambling 
houses understand that the laws of probability are in their favor 
eventually and that they’ll take their share as long as everyone keeps 
playing. The weapon rewards honest gambling providing the wielder 
advantages when wagering either blood or coin. Knowledgeable PC’s will 
have heard that clubs like these are sometimes found in upscale gambling
 halls, racetracks and casinos, usually carried by guards who double as 
dealers or bookies. To benefit from the weapon’s powers the wielder must
 have participated in games of chance or skill and won or lost at least 5
 gold pieces per character level through bets or wagers in the past 24 
hours and has not cheated or aided someone else to cheat in a game of 
chance or skill in the past seven days. A bearer who meets these 
requirements gains advantage on any checks made to detect or notice 
other creatures cheating in games of skill or chance. A wielder who 
meets the requirements is able to roll 2d10’s to hit when attacking with
 the weapon rather than the typical 1d20. The roll is considered a 
natural 1 or a critical fumble if both dice roll 1’s, whereas a natural 
20 or a critical hit occurs when the rolled dice added up to that 
result. —Note: “Gambling” can be anything from betting on horse racing, 
playing dice or cards to just making a 5 gp per level wager on the 
result of a single coin flip. To minimize abuse I recommend against 
betting gold with a fellow PC who might forgive a loss or forget to 
collect a winning. A DM might rule that the gold must be won or lost to 
NPC’s unless the PC’s are good roleplayers and don’t take advantage of 
the mechanic. If you are not using a d20 system (Rolling multiple d6’s 
or d10’d for example), or you don’t want to use the benefit for balance 
purposes, you can instead treat this as a +1 weapon if the wielder meets
 the requirement.</p>

of magical wards layered upon it, the dagger is relatively plain looking
 with a single edged steel blade and a polished walnut grip. Its 
waterproof leather sheath can be hung at the bearer’s belt of be 
adjusted to be strapped to an arm or leg where it can be easily drawn. 
The knife can function as a weapon as well as a survival tool and in 
either case, its wielder can always rely on its blade to stay sharp and 
strike true. Old Faithful may never land a critical blow or be as flashy
 as a paladin’s glowing greatsword but she’ll hit harder and more 
accurately than any other belt knife you’ll ever own and her blade won’t
 snap when your life depends on it. The dagger is treated as a +1 but 
whenever the weapon would score a critical hit against an enemy, the 
critical hit is negated and the attack is considered a successful but 
non-critical attack instead for all purposes. The dagger is five times 
more durable than normal, never breaks, chips or dulls as a result of 
casual use and is all but impossible to break or damage as a result of 
combat, even when targeted by enemies who attempt sundering or weapon 
breaking techniques. —Note: Depending on your game system the weapon may
 either have five times as many hit points or have a greatly increased 
hardness or damage reducing quality. If there is no existing system in 
place and weapons simply break or do not break as a result of damage, 
consider giving the weapon five “charges” or “lives”. Each time it would
 be broken as a result of damage, it instead remains fully intact but 
looses a life or charge and it is destroyed when all five have been used

shaped link, rimmed with copper. The last few links of either side of 
the chain’s seven foot length are enlarged and enhanced with large 
jagged spikes. The chain flickers with jolts of power and discharges 
small static shocks on a regular basis and when held, the wielder’s hair
 stands on end and small arcs of electricity to jump between fingers and
 strands of hair. When actively being used in combat, the electricity 
charges and discharges faster as the weapon audible crackles and 
violently sparks. The weapon’s conductive nature directs lethal jolts of
 power directly into the target’s body, shocking the delicate nervous 
system and leaving smoking, flash burned skin. Half of the damage dealt 
by the spiked chain is considered lighting damage while the rest is 
normal for its type. Whenever the wielder brings a creature to 0 hit 
points or kills a creature with a blow from the spiked chain, any damage
 in excess of that needed to kill or down the creature surges in the 
corpse and can be redirected. The wielder can immediately choose another
 creature he can see within 50 feet of the dead creature and launch a 
bolt of electricity at them which automatically hits, dealing lighting 
damage equal to the amount of damage left over after bringing the 
original target to 0 hit points. If this lighting bolt kills the second 
target, the wielder may repeat the process on a third target (Then 
forth, fifth, etc) until there is no more excess damage. —Note: A combat
 example: The wielder hits a near death creature who has 5 hit points, 
and deals 20 damage. The creature dies at 0 hp and the wilder directs a 
lighting bolt dealing 15 damage at another wounded creature who has 10 
hp remaining. The second creature also dies and the wielder directs 
another lighting bolt at a third creature which deals 5 damage, leaving 
the third target injured but alive.</p>

(Club statistics) which imparts its wielder with the distance and 
direction of the nearest body of saltwater. Knowledgeable PC’s will 
recognize this a sort of inside joke among sailors and seafaring folk. 
Items like this are sometimes given to (Or strapped to) sailors 
disembarking at port who are well known blackout drunks. The idea is 
that no matter where they wind up, how little (If at all) they remember 
and how drunk they still may be the next morning, they’ll still be able 
to navigate themselves back to port and reach the ship before she sails 
without them. Occasionally these items have variations of the phrase “If
 found please return this miserable crew mate and object to the -Insert 
Ship Name Here- for a cash reward” for added humor at that sailor’s 
expense. Sailor’s are known to be a superstitious lot and the club seems
 to become inexplicably more lethal if its has been completely immersed 
in seawater within the past 24 hours. If it has been dunked in saltwater
 within one day’s time, whenever the player rolls a damage die he must 
roll a second confirming die of the same sort. If the second die is the 
same result as the first, the player is considered to have instead 
rolled the maximum possible result for that type of die instead of the 
current result. —Note: Combat example: The wielder attacks with Compass 
of the Sealegged, hits and rolls 1d4 damage. The first damage die is a 1
 and the confirming die is also a 1. Since the rolls match, the wielder 
deals 4 damage instead of 1. If the confirming die was a 4 the wielder 
would deal the original 1 damage. This only affects the weapon’s damage 
itself and not other sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, 
divine smite or spell effects. I recommend that the player or DM assign a
 color system so avoid confusion, for example the first die is always 
blue and the confirming die is always red. This way both dice can be 
rolled at the same die to speed the process along.</p>

self-control when held. The shortsword glows slightly and is treated as 
+1 when held by a virgin creature. Female virgins can wield the blade 
regardless of their normal weapon proficiencies and may use their 
dexterity or charisma (Or other mental statistic representing 
personality or force of will) in place of strength to determine their 
accuracy and damage rolls when attacking with the weapon. Knowledgeable 
PC’s will know that legend holds that this specific blade was 
commissioned by a high ranking noble in a city infamous for its duels 
among the young noble born men. Most of the city’s politics, arguments, 
court systems, important trade deals, negotiations and even minor 
differences of opinion were settled with formal duels that always 
resulted in blood and occasionally death. The commissioner was a wealthy
 merchant who had a teenage daughter who wished to follow in her father 
business but could not navigate the social circles of the city as she 
was not allowed to duel under the law. The blade allowed her to duel 
through the sheer force of her fiery personality and she was able to 
carve a measure of respect and blood out of her male peers before she 
fell in love and gracefully retired, passing the blade along to a 
younger friend who wished to follow in her footsteps. —Note: Themes 
regarding sexuality may not be appropriate for all groups and DM’s

 greenish shine. At the base, the tentacles part to reveal a seeking, 
inhuman eye. Grasping the weapon momentarily fills the wielder’s mind 
with immense leviathans sleeping within planes of alien geometries, 
eldritch tomes filled with shifting black script that burns the eyes and
 shatters the mind and revelations of truths of things man was never 
meant to know. When the wielder makes an attack with the sword on his 
turn, he can choose to increase the reach of the attack by five feet. 
When the weapon is swung this way, the blade takes the shape of a 
tentacle and grows in length to strike at the enemy. A creature struck

staff’s mental voice is deep, slow and ponderous and creaks with the 
sound of wood on wood. The staff name is a mixture of noises involving 
bird songs, wind through leafy branches and the pitter patter of a 
gentle rain, that isn’t pronounceable by most creatures. It enjoys 
waxing nostalgic about growing, the deliciously warm rays of the sun, 
the feel of its roots in the dirt, the gentle breeze and its branches 
and the feel of squirrels and birds tickling its bark. It enjoys being 
planted in good soil during sunny days and watered as if it was still

gives knowledgeable advice on nature, usually focusing on plants, the 
weather or the quality of the soil. Seeking advice from the staff can be
 tedious as it is slow to speak and even slower to respond to questions.
 A minute of normal conversation can sometimes be stretched out over an 
hour of creaky mental speech and painfully long silences. A bearer who 
has had the staff in their possession for at least three days (And has 
spoken with it occasionally even by just virtue of using it as a walking

creatures and considerable damage to some types of undead. Outside of 
combat, the weapon can be hung horizontally above a barely dressed 
creature and be used as a tanning light or to grow small amounts of 
plants in otherwise dark environments. To retain its enchantment, the 
weapon must spent at least one non-consecutive hour per week in direct 
natural sunlight, absorbing the solar energy and storing it within 
itself. If this requirement is not met, the sword’s magic begins to fade
 and it enters a state of hibernation for up to 30 days during which 
time it does not glow or provide its combat bonus. To be brought out of 
hibernation the weapon must spent a total of eight consecutive hours in 
direct natural sunlight at which point it returns to normal functioning.

                <td><p>Tidespear: A beautiful weapon that at its most 
basic, is a solid metal trident of fine craftsmanship, ornately 
decorated with inlaid runes and bearing the Sea God’s blessing. The 
weapon appears to be covered at all times by a film of water, constantly
 flowing from the weighted butt towards the points but only ever 
spilling droplets when striking. While it feels wet to the touch, it 
does not slip in the hand, and the film will flow over the wielder’s 
hand without leaving a trace. The weapon’s quality is superb, its fine 
balance allowing both for lightning-fast stabs and powerful strikes with
 either heavy end. The Tidespear however is more than merely a finely 
crafted weapon; it is a source and focus of water magic. In water, it 
moves with as much resistance as if it were swung through air; on dry 
land, when swung or thrust, the water film flows off the points, 
creating an edge that can pierce armor with surprising ease and adds 
weight and force to every strike. In the hands of a strong wielder the 
magic becomes even more apparent as the watery film becomes a weapon in 
its own right. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with a
 lower strength score than himself, he may choose to launch a geyser of 
water from Tidespear’s prongs which pushes the target five feet 
backwards. When this occurs the target becomes drenched in saltwater 
putting out mundane flames and should the target be primarily made of 
fire or particularly harmed by water (Such as a fire elemental or the 
Wicked Witch of the West) the suffers additional damage equal to a 
shortsword.</p>

hair and burdened down with the bones of the unquiet dead who rose from 
the grave as restless ghosts. A wielder can feel their hands partially 
pass through the translucent, gossamer-thin netting as if the material 
was just not physically present in some places. The quasi-spectral net 
shares the incorporeal properties as the beings it was made from and can
 be used as a tool for capturing and subduing violent spirits. The 
weapon can be used like a typical weighted net against incorporeal or 
ethereal creatures who are affected by the net as if they were not 
incorporeal and on a successful hit the target becomes restrained (See 
Note) by the netting. The captured target can attempt to break free of 
the weighted net as one would from a typical net, using the same actions
 and checks. As the netting still retains its partially solid properties
 a restrained ethereal being is not able to simply phase through it or 
nearby floors or ceilings to extract itself from the net. The delicate 
material of the weapon is too flimsy to use on solid targets and cannot 
be used on fully corporeal targets. If the netting is damaged as a 
result of combat, the material can be invigorated by wrapping it around a
 living creature for one hour which saps out some of their life force 
(Dealing damage equivalent to a shortsword) but fully repairs the 
weapon. —Note: Being hit by the weighted net deals whatever status 
effect a typical net bestows to the target. For the purposes of this 
weapon the terms incorporeal and ethereal are interchangeable.</p>

 single piece of metal. It surface has no blemishes or distinguishing 
marks, and its haft is wrapped in dry, leathery, ancient skin. The 
warhammer is particularly effective against the vile undead who when 
struck by the weapon, cannot regain hit points until the start of the 
wielder’s next turn. The weapon is half again as heavy as a typical 
warhammer and every once in a while the full weight of the enormous 
bludgeoning device swings perfectly into the enemy for a particularly 
resounding blow. Whenever the player rolls a damage die he must roll a 
second confirming die of the same sort. If the second die is the same 
result as the first, the player is considered to have instead rolled the
 maximum possible result for that type of die instead of the current 
result. A bearer who has ever created, raised or commanded an undead 
creature finds the warhammer impossibly heavy and is not able to lift or
 carry it and cannot wield it whatsoever. —Note: A combat example; a 
wielder hits with Ghoul’s Lament and is rolling 1d8 damage. The first 
damage die is a 2 and the confirming die is also a 2. Since the rolls 
match, the wielder deals 8 damage instead of 2. If the confirming die 
was a 7, the wielder would deal the original 2 damage. This only affects
 the weapon’s damage itself and not other sources of additional damage 
such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. I recommend that 
the player or DM assign a color system so avoid confusion, for example 
the first die is always blue and the confirming die is always red. This 
way both dice can be rolled at the same die to speed the process along. 
The second effect that deals with primary and confirmation dice trigger 
on every hit not just against undead targets.</p>

untapped power that exists in two states. In its dormant state, the 
blade is retracted and the crossbars are curved downwards, making it a 
functional dagger. When verbally commanded to change (An action 
equivalent to drawing a weapon), the sword awakens and the blade of the 
sword grows to almost triple its length while the crossbars curl upward 
revealing a stunning longsword. Embedded in the hilt of the weapon is a 
strange, eye-shaped jewel that radiates power. While the sword is in its
 dormant state, the gem resembles a cat’s eye, dark brown in color with a
 yellow pupil. When awakened, the eye transforms displaying the image of
 a snarling head of a lion in black on a field of bright red. The Sword 
of Omens possesses a certain level of consciousness and feels alive in 
the bearer’s hands but a never seems to directly interact with him. 
Perhaps it is waiting for the right wielder to unlock its full potential
 as it does discriminate against those who would use its power for 
nefarious purposes. Any non-evil wielder can tap into some of its 
powers, the least of which is that half of the damage dealt by the 
weapon (In either form) is considered thunder damage while the rest is 
normal for its type. The sword of omens grants its bearer sight beyond 
sight and those who carry the weapon on their person for some time, 
begins to receive strange new sensations of things yet to come and 
glimpses of the future begin to press in on their awareness. A chosen 
few of the premonitions are flashes of second sight into the bearer’s 
own destiny. These harbingers of the future can be exploited to spin the
 threads of fate into a pattern of the bearer’s favor. After finishing a
 long rest during which the weapon has been in the bearer’s possession, 
the player rolls 1d20 and records the number rolled. While the weapon is
 wielded by that specific bearer, he can choose to replace any attack 
roll made by the wielder or a creature that he can see with the 
foretelling roll. The wielder must choose to do so before the roll is 
made. The foretelling roll can be used only once and when the bearer 
finishes another long rest, he loses any unused foretelling rolls.</p>

 to awaken in times of need. When stirred, his inner beast bursts forth 
and he becomes an engine or destruction. The wielder’s blows rain down 
harder and his skin hardens shrugging off minor wounds. On his turn the 
wielder can enter a frenzied state. During this time his melee attacks 
are treated as a +1’s and and all incoming sources of nonmagical 
slashing bludgeoning and piercing damage are reduced by 1 hit point. At 
the end of one minute the rage ends and the wielder is left exhausted as
 if they had gone a night without sleeping. Creatures who are immune 
from becoming exhausted are not able to activate the berserker state, as
 the frenzy specifically requires the wielder to push past their body’s 
normal limits severely overworking their muscles and adrenal system.</p>

materials with negligible resistance. The other side is made of an 
unknown, shade-coloured metal with a narrowed point is so fine that it 
is impossible to see the edge with a naked eye.  The subtle dagger’s 
handle is made of wood, adorned with a relief made of golden wire in the
 shape of an angel with spread wings on one side, and closed wings on 
the other. The wire is slightly elevated from the wood of the handle to 
ensure a firm grip on the weapon. The knife is stored in a custom 
leather sheath with straps meant to hold the dagger in place while not 
in use, as otherwise it would slice through even the thickest leather. 
The weapon has spent ages exposed to magical dust that has imbued it 
with mystical energy and reinforcing its supernaturally honed blade. The
 dagger is considered a magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming 
resistances, damage reduction and other defenses and whenever the player
 rolls the maximum result on the knife’s damage die (I.e. a 4 on a 
four-sided die.), they can roll that die an additional time and add both
 results to the total damage dealt. This ability can trigger multiple

for casting ranged spells that require an attack roll. Twice per day, 
the wielder can channel a spell through the crossbow to gain advantage

evidently the mark of the blade’s maker, but who the maker was has been

Note), but while it is held unsheathed, the bearer is protected from 
fire, siphoning away some of the flame’s intense heat and storing it 
within the blade until it can be released. Whenever the wielder would

 him during his captivity. The viewer is free to forgo the deal, but if 
accepted that wielder treats the Emberfork as a +1 weapon and half of 
the damage it deals is considered fire damage while the rest is normal 
for its type. During this time the wielder’s maximum hit points are 
reduced by one hit point per character level (Or 10% of maximum health 
or other equivalent amount) and he suffers disadvantage on death saving 
throws. Raazkal’s contract lasts for 24 hours, after which all of the

The wielder experiences elegant, almost grandiose sensations when they

fighting. The best performers are paid handsomely for their physical 
displays, and so in turn does the sword provide riches to those who 
wield it with critical perfection. When the wielder lands a critical 
hit, instead of producing blood, ichor, tree sap, sloughs of undead 
flesh or other similar substance, the target shreds pure silver 
droplets. The equivalent of one silver coin per point of hit point 
damage dealt by the critical hit (In total, to a maximum limit of the

form of rust, acid, or corrosion which don’t even leave a mark. Ironfang
 contains a spark of Ogremoch, the archomental Prince of Evil Earth and 
the tiny fragment of his essence influences the bearer, encouraging him 
to act in a miserly and destructive fashion. A long term bearer may 
discover his personality changing, finding that he is more likely to 
break things, cause ruin and hoard wealth on principle. The bearer is 
never forced to act on these feelings but so long as he carries the 
weapon he may be swayed by its influence. The war pick is not without 
benefit however and the shred of the prince’s pure elemental power 
trapped within it grants a limited mastery over earth. The wielder can 
choose a portion of loose earth that he can see within 30 feet and that 
fits within a five-foot cube and instantaneously excavate it, moving it 
along the ground, and depositing it up to five feet away. This movement 
doesn’t involve enough force to cause damage. When used in combat, 
abnormally powerful attacks cause the soil itself to rise up against the
 wielder’s foes. Whenever the wielder scores a critical hit, a fountain 
of churned earth and stone erupts underneath the target and a human 
sized hand made from compacted soil rises and grasps the creature. The 
victim of the critical hit becomes grappled by the gravelly limb until 
the start of the wielder’s next turn when the hand crumbles to inanimate
 dirt or until the target breaks free by making an opposing check as if 
the wielder was grappling him.</p>

                <td><p>Glass Cannon: A heavy crossbow inexplicably made 
solely of a crystal clear, glass prism. The entire weapon (Including 
somehow, the string) is made from one single piece of the glass that 
seems to neither have been poured, nor blown into its current shape. The
 transparent material refracts even the weakest light into a rainbow of 
colours that shine in all directions. The glass has been magically 
enchanted to be stronger than steel and the crossbow is as flexible and 
functional as a typical one of its kind. Regardless of the material 
components of its frame, the heavy crossbow is brutally effective, 
capable of firing lethal bolts with enough power to punch clear through 
plate mail, killing an armored knight with a pull of the trigger. The 
heavy crossbow’s damage dice increases by one step to the next largest 
die and whenever the player rolls to determine the Glass Cannon’s damage
 (See Note), he may roll the weapon’s damage die twice and choose either
 result to use. Unfortunately for the bearer, the enchantments that 
provide the crossbow its lethal potential and unbreakable nature 
function by sapping the wielder of his vitality and resilience. While 
Glass Cannon is being wielded and for one hour afterwards, anytime the 
bearer takes at least 1 hit point worth of damage from any source, the 
amount of damage the bearer receives is increased by 1 hit point, due to
 the weapon’s drain on his constitution. —Note: For example, if a normal
 heavy crossbow deals 1d10 damage, Glass Cannon deals 1d12. This only 
affects the weapon’s damage itself and not other sources of additional 
damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell effects. A combat 
example: The wielder is stabbed with a dagger and would normally only 
take 4 points of damage but because he is wielding Glass Cannon (Or has 
actively wielded it in the past hour) he takes 5 points of damage 
instead.</p>

 with a the symbol of a sundial carved into its grip. The weapon is of a
 strangely intermediate age, changing constantly from appearing brand 
new, in mint condition and barely a day old, to looking ancient, 
battered and weathered, seeming centuries old and fluctuating along 
every age in between. A slight haze surrounds the sword glittering with 
chronomantic magic that bends time around itself in inconsequential 
ways. An autumn leaf falling near the blade might turn from fall orange 
to the bright fresh green of spring or shrivel to the black of winter 
and disintegrate into dust, before leaving the weapon’s aura of 
influence and return to normal. In combat the wielder is engulfed in the
 chaotic time-field and will sometimes see enemies attacking impossibly 
quickly, only for their attack to slow to a crawl just before landing, 
allowing the wielding to react in time. The arbitrary hasting and 
slowing of the wielder’s environment balances out equally, neither 
hindering nor boosting his combat prowess. The wielder does gain a 
fleeting moment of control over the shifting aeonic energies on truly 
powerful blows, allowing himself to accelerate his reaction or delay his
 target’s response. Whenever the wielder lands a critical hit, he can 
harness the resulting temporal flux in and choose one of two options to 
take effect; 1, The wielder can hasten himself, gaining the highest 
initiative result and placing himself first in the initiative order out 
all creatures involved. 2, The wielder can slow the target, causing the 
victim to acquire the lowest initiative result, placing the target last 
in the initiative order out all creatures involved. Both effects begin 
on the next round of initiative and last until the end of the current 
combat. If the wielder sends multiple creatures to the bottom of the 
initiative, the most recent one to be sent to the bottom is considered 
the last one to have a turn in the round. If there is no current 
initiative order, the wielder can instead choose to grant himself 
advantage, or grant the target disadvantage on initiative checks made 
for the next hour.</p>

                <td><p>Roulette: A uniquely engineered weapon that is 
essentially a greatly modified heavy crossbow with a gambling motif. The
 marvel of modern technology completely lacks the typical bowed limbs 
and string that give the crossbow its name. In their place the weapon 
has a large, cylindrical, metal drum that can spin like a wheel and is 
mounted to the weapon’s main stock. Said stock is made of glossy 
mahogany and the drum is decorated like a roulette wheel with each 
barrel painted alternating red or black along the sides. The front of 
the drum displays a green inner circle surrounded by the red and black 
sections. Looking straight into the drum from the business end of the 
weapon one can see six individual barrels within, each loaded with a 
sling bullet ready to be fired. Within each barrel also rests a tightly 
wound steel spring cocked back into a loaded position that when 
released, serves as the bullet’s driving kinetic force. The weapon 
sports two triggers, one fires a loaded bullet while the other rotates 
the drum so that another barrel with an already readied bullet lines 
itself up with the stocks sights and is instantly able to be shot. This 
allows the wielder to ignore the usual loading qualities of standard 
crossbows in a pinch, though the wielder can reload the empty barrel 
rather than rotate the drum which takes the same action as a typical 
crossbow. Although supremely engineered, the weapon does have its quirks
 and will sometimes fire more than it’s supposed to, and occasionally 
the wielder will get lucky and the drum immediately rotates and shoots 
another bullet striking the target twice in one attack. Whenever the 
player rolls the weapon’s damage die he must roll a second confirming 
die of the same sort. If the second die is the same result as the first,
 the player adds both dice to the total damage rolled and Roulette fires
 two bullets. —Note: TLDR: This is essentially a six-shooter revolver in
 heavy crossbow form. A wielder can essentially ignore the Loading 
property on a crossbow up to six times per combat, or less if they get 
lucky and trigger the damage effect. This is essentially a different 
take on a repeating crossbow design. It allows players with multiple 
attacks in a round be better able to make use of a crossbow without 
worrying as much about loading times. Although a PC could theoretically 
dual wield this weapon, normal two weapon fighting limits apply making 
light and heavy “Roulette” type crossbows unfeasible to dual wield. 
Combat example: The wielder fires a heavy Roulette, hits and rolls 1d10 
damage. The first damage die is a 6 and the confirming die is also a 6. 
Since the rolls match the damage, the wielder deals 12 damage instead of
 6. If the confirming die was a 10 the wielder would deal the original 6
 damage. This only affects the weapon’s damage itself and not other 
sources of additional damage such as sneak attack, divine smite or spell
 effects. I recommend that the player or DM assign a color system so 
avoid confusion, for example the first die is always blue and the 
confirming die is always red. This way both dice can be rolled at the 
same die to speed the process along.</p>
